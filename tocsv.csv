8938,Building a Data Culture,"<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/virt_1_346x214.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-8939"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/virt_1_346x214-300x185.jpg"" alt=""virt_1_346x214"" width=""300"" height=""185"" /></a>Many companies want to ‘do’ big data today. They’re spending money on systems, software, consulting, training and other services to be able to capture, process, analyze and use data. Those are all things that need to be done to be up their data science capabilities and skills. Companies need the right platforms, the right systems, the right people and skills to be able to properly analyze and use their data.

There’s one area that many organizations fail to address when building up their data analytics programs and skills. That area involves the corporate culture. Specifically, it involves the culture around listening, curiosity, investigation and willingness to try and fail.

Corporate culture can play a huge role in the success or failure of data analytics programs. If your company’s culture doesn’t like hearing new data that may provide conflicting information, your big data initiatives may be set up for failure from the very beginning.

In my experiences, the ability to listen and act on new data is one of the most important aspects of corporate culture that leads to success with data analytics and big data. If you don’t have a corporate culture and leadership team willing to listen to new information. For example, if your CEO doesn’t listen to data or arguments that go against her beliefs, you may be in for a very difficult time if your data analysis shows a reality different than the one that she expects or wants.

While listening and accepting competing arguments and data is the top cultural issue that can make or break big data, the other cultural aspects are important as well. For example, if the people who are working with your data aren’t curious about the data and willing to spend plenty of time investigating that data then you may be wasting money giving those people the proper skills to become a data scientist. You may be training them to act as your data scientists, but if they aren’t interested in finding out more about your data and investigation new avenues of analysis, you may not get the move value from them or your big data initiatives.

Lastly, your corporate culture should be willing to accept failure. Now, I’m not saying you should embrace or excuse failure, but many times in the data analysis world you end up finding analyses that don’t match with your expectations. Much of the time spent by data scientists is spent in small analysis projects looking for new ways to look at data. Many of these small projects end in failure with nothing of measurable value to show for the time spent on that project. Even though it may seem like wasted time, these types of projects are what make great data scientists as it allows them to continuously improve on their skills.

Successfully implementing big data initiatives is much more than just buying some software or systems. Successful big data initiatives require <a href=""http://www.allanalytics.com/video.asp?section_id=1860&amp;doc_id=272877"">working on soft skills as well as organizational culture</a> to ensure that the big data mindset is ingrained throughout the organization.

8943,"Note to Self - Don't say ""Data Driven"" Anymore","<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/data.jpeg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-8944"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/data-300x199.jpeg"" alt=""data"" width=""300"" height=""199"" /></a>Jim Harris just wrote a nice piece titled ""<a title=""It’s Not about being Data-Driven"" href=""http://www.ocdqblog.com/home/its-not-about-being-data-driven"" target=""_blank"">It's not about being Data Driven</a>"" over on his wonderful Obsessive-Compulsive Data Quality Blog.  If you don't have Jim's blog on your radar, you should...he does great work over there.

In this recent post, Jim writes about the difference between being 'data-driven' and using data to make better decisions.  Jim writes:
<blockquote>In the era of big data, it’s not about being data-driven—because your organization has always been data-driven. It’s about what data your organization is being driven by—and whether that data is driving your organization to make better decisions.</blockquote>
I've been guilty of writing about companies needing to be 'data-driven' without making the very important distinction that Jim points out there. Success doesn't come about because a company is data-driven...success comes from what a company does with their data and how they use that data to inform their decisions.

Jim is correct that many companies have been 'data-driven' for years. Most businesses would argue that they've been data-driven since inception. Most managers love to look at data to help them make decisions but I'd argue that many managers have historically looked at data in the wrong way. They looked at data as their 'truth' of how their team was doing. They looked at their data as a way to understand how their business was doing.   Many managers even look at their data as a way to improve their businesses.

The push for 'being data-driven' today can often make many of these managers angry, and rightfully so.  These managers aren't idiots...they know data is important. They've always used data.

So...let's stop imploring these managers and companies to be data-driven and start asking them to look at the data they're using. Are they using all the data available to them? Is the quality of their data at question? Can they point to a full lifecycle of data management for their data? Can they ensure security, quality and governance of that data?

If they can't answer these types of questions in a positive manner, its time for them to visit their data management and data quality processes and systems. Perhaps they've always been a data-driven company but they may have been using bad data or maybe they've just been using the wrong data.

Once an organization's data quality and management practices are understood and new processes/systems implemented (if needed), the next question has to be about how that company uses their data. Do they use it to make decisions? Do they dive deep into the data to look for new ideas and problems to solve? Or do they just use that data as a way to point to how 'great' their business is?

There's different ways of being data-driven, but like Jim said...the only way to be successful at using data is to use it to make better decisions.  Your organization can be data-driven and still be very unsuccessful. Find the data and data systems that work for your business and use them to make great decisions to make your company better.",20141120,http://ericbrown.com/dont-say-data-driven-anymore.htm,Big Data|Leadership,Big Data|data-driven|Knowledge Management|Organization

8952,The Cloud - Gateway to Enterprise Mobility,"<em>This post is brought to you by the</em> <a href=""http://bit.ly/1ByYPYr""><em>Enterprise CIO Forum</em></a><em> and HP’s</em> <a href=""http://bit.ly/10l0SE2""><em>Make It Matter</em></a><em>.</em>

<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/cloud-diagram.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-8955"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/cloud-diagram-300x236.jpg"" alt=""cloud-diagram"" width=""300"" height=""236"" /></a>Can you remember what it was like to do your job ten years ago? For the most part, you were stuck to your desk and most likely using your large desktop computer with a very large CRT monitor. If you were lucky, you might have received a laptop that let you move around the office and/or travel for business and drag along your lightweight laptop. Of course, these lightweight laptops weren’t really that lightweight but they did let you know work away from the office whenever you needed to. Lastly, those that were really lucky might have a blackberry device to keep on top of their email.

The world of mobile ten years ago was one that was mobile, but wasn’t. Sure you could get away from your desk but you weren’t always able to do everything you needed to.   The security issues that existed were fairly minor. Companies setup virtual private networks (VPN’s) to allow access to the company systems from outside the firewall. Access via blackberry devices were fairly secure and straightforward. Access other than VPN or blackberry was generally unavailable outside the office. There was rarely thought given to other mobile devices other mobile access and very rarely the capability for employees to bring their own devices into the corporate environment and network.

Today, mobility is much different in most organizations. Laptops are more than ubiquitous and people are regularly working from inside and outside the organization’s firewall. In addition to laptops, tablets and smartphones are almost as ubiquitous throughout organizations today with many being personal devices brought into the organization from employees.

IT operations and security have their hands full with the various mobile devices and mobility requirements placed upon them by the wants and needs of the organization. Many organizations have mobility solutions and systems on their ‘to do’ list to ensure mobility is implemented in a way that allows the organization to meet their goals and objectives.

According to a <a href=""http://h20195.www2.hp.com/V2/GetDocument.aspx?docname=4AA4-7393ENW&amp;cc=us&amp;lc=en"">recent report by IDG Research</a>, 54% of organizations have a mobility strategy and have begun some form of implementation while 38% of companies are currently formulating a mobility strategy. Those are fairly good numbers that show most companies have identified mobility as a key issue for the future and are trying to address it head on. While these companies seem to have a strategy and implementation plans, both need to be flexible during and after implementation to incorporate new technologies and systems.

One of the main focus points for mobility strategies for organizations should be the cloud. The cloud is a game-changer when it comes to mobility strategy and implementations. The cloud can help off-load already over-burned data centers and IT systems as well as helping to make the bring-your-own-device (BYOD) paradigm a reality with very little overhead within the organization.

Enterprise mobility is a necessity for organizations today, tomorrow and into the future. Using the cloud to help facilitate mobility is a no-brainer today as it allows for mobility to exist from the very beginning of the system lifecycle.   With proper planning, the cloud can bring the ultimate mobility to an organization while still provide great data security and data access from anywhere in the world.

How well is your organization planning for mobility within your enterprise?

8957,The Agile Data Center,"<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Server-Room-726x400.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-8959"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Server-Room-726x400-300x165.jpg"" alt=""Server-Room-726x400"" width=""300"" height=""165"" /></a>I participated in the <a title=""Data Center Twitter Chat"" href=""https://twitter.com/search?q=%23datactrchat"" target=""_blank"">#DataCtrChat</a> Twitter chat last week to join in on the conversation about the Agile Data Center. If you haven’t joined in on a Twitter chat recently, you should. The #DataCtrChat is a great one to be a part of, especially if you’re interested in the data center.

One of the questions in last week’s chat was a simple one, but one that has a complex answer. The question was:
<blockquote><em>What differentiates an Agile Data Center from a traditional data center?</em></blockquote>
That is an easy question to ask but is a very difficult one to answer. The answer really depends on how each organization views and uses their data center, but I’m going to try to develop an answer in this post.

Every company has a different view about their data center. Some organizations may outsource their entire data center, others may have some cloud presence combined with an on-premises data center while others may have a completely on-premises data center.

Because each organization has a different definition for their data center, it’s difficult to provide a one-size-fits-all answer to the differences between an agile data center and a traditional data center.

That said, we can easily talk about the concept of ‘agility’ within a data center. Regardless of how a company views and uses their data center, there is always room for an agile mindset within the data center.

Thinking about agility within the data center opens up many new avenues for companies to explore. With agility in the forefront of data center planning combined with proper planning around security and operations, organizations can begin to think about utilizing their data center in new and innovative ways. With an agile mindset, the concept of the data center moves away from being a liability that continuously consumes resources to being an efficient and effective way to deliver services to internal and external clients.

With all of this in mind, we can now take a stab at making a generalized answer to the question posed previously. The difference between an “Agile” data center and the “traditional” data center can be summed up with the following sentence:
<blockquote><em>An Agile Data Center is one that allows organizations to efficiently and effectively add, remove and change services at the speed of the business, not the speed of technology.</em></blockquote>
In the ‘old’ days of the data center, if the business needed more processing power, someone in IT would need to find an underutilized server and then add that server to whatever platform was needed. In recent years, virtualization could have been used to build a new virtual machine to be provide the processing power needed.

Before virtualization, finding and operationalizing the necessary processor power could take days, weeks or even months. With virtualization, it usually takes much less time to get systems up and running but there are still delays in most organizations.

With the agile mindset and proper planning and system implementation, organizations can go from delays of days to delays of minutes. Using cloud systems and automation, that request for more processing power could take a few minutes rather than a few days. That’s the power of the agile mindset when it comes to the data center.

Agility doesn’t necessarily mean new systems nor does it mean moving your data center to the cloud. It <strong><em>does</em></strong> mean thinking about your data center and your data center capabilities in new ways and then putting in new processes (and perhaps, new systems) to make the data center flexible and agile.

8965,When life gives you a little fog...,"It's been a bit quiet around here the past week. I've been doing some traveling over the holidays and enjoying some time with my wife and our cameras.

This morning, we went out to one of the best locations in the area for bird watching and photography. We were pretty sure we wouldn't see much nor get any good photographs due to the very thick fog that had rolled in overnight. Rather than give up and go back once we saw how bad the fog really was, we decided to get out and walk around a bit and just give it a shot...maybe we'd be able to find something good in the fog.

I'm glad we decided to give it a shot...we saw quite a few Herons, Egrets, Pelicans and other shorebirds.  While the fog kept us from getting those 'textbook perfect' shots, I think I was able to grab a few great ones. Here's a few shots from this morning. Enjoy.

This post is just a friendly reminder that you don't always get the perfect weather but you can still make good things happen with whatever weather you have.

There was a line in that article that really caught my eye. The quote from the article is provided below:
<blockquote>As CIO, you want a CMO to be safe and avoid obvious risk. Marketing has a cultural need to be innovative.</blockquote>
Now, there's something to be said for avoiding obvious risk. You don't want to rush off into the world and take on every risk that comes along but you also don't want to avoid any risk altogether. Part of being in any leadership role is to decide on what risks are worth taking and then determining how to manage those risks.

There's a considerable different between avoiding risk and managing risk.  When  you avoid risk, you put yourself and your company at a disadvantage.  As a CIO (or CMO) you should never want to avoid risk at all...your goal should be to identify and manage the risks that are necessary to ensure your organization meets its goals.

Back to that quote from the McKinsey article regarding CIO's wanting CMO's to be ""safe and avoid obvious risk"".  While I understand and can somewhat agree with the spirit behind the statement, I can't agree with the statement itself.    If I were a CIO, I'd want the CMO (or any other colleague) to identify and manage risk, not avoid it. In fact, if risks are 'obvious' there's generally a way to manage those risks. It's usually the non-obvious risks that really cause the most trouble for an organization.

Rather than avoiding risks, the job of a leader should be managing risk and mitigating risk. Every activity undertaken by an organization has some risk involved with it. Software development has risk.  Outsourcing has risk. Using cloud services has risk.  The difference in whether any project is a success or failure lay partly in how risks are managed and mitigated.

I have to ask you...are you managing risk or avoiding risk?",20141208,http://ericbrown.com/are-you-avoiding-risk-or-managing-risk.htm,Leadership|The New CIO,CIO|CMO|Leadership|Management
9001,The Sidelined CIO,"<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/soc14-info-ss3-100526352-gallery.idge_.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-9003"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/soc14-info-ss3-100526352-gallery.idge_-300x225.jpg"" alt=""soc14-info-ss3-100526352-gallery.idge"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /></a>The <a href=""http://www.cio.com/article/2380234/cio-role/state-of-the-cio-2014-the-great-schism.html"">2014 CIO State of the CIO Survey</a> has some interesting data related to the role of the CIO. One of the interesting pieces of that survey relates to the idea that CIO’s are feeling as though they are being pushed aside. <a href=""http://epictechpage.com/sms/symantec/blog/2014/10/11/sidelined-cio/"">Nearly 30 percent of CIO’s reportedly feel</a> ‘sidelined in their businesses as they watch shadow IT increase.’

My instinct tells me that many of those 30 percent of CIO’s are struggling today because they haven’t taken the step forward to drive innovation within the organization, embrace new systems and help their organization’s drive new technology adoption to allow for flexible and agile service delivery for internal and external clients.

In most cases, if your role and your organization isn’t seen as one that delivers innovative ideas, the organization will find a way to work around you. That’s what is happening with many of these CIO’s who feel sidelined. These CIO’s have stayed in the ‘old world’ of IT where no technology project was initiated without their approval. These CIO’s are seeing themselves sidelined today because they are still waiting to be asked to ‘help’ when, in fact, most parts of the business can turn up new systems and services at the push of a button with Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) or Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) providers.

Being sidelined is no fun, regardless of what role you currently hold but being sidelined as a CIO must be extremely frustrating. There’s a secret that most of these sidelined CIO’s don’t know though. That secret has to do with leadership from the CIO.

Martha Heller, author of the <a href=""http://www.hellersearch.com/the-cio-paradox/"">CIO Paradox</a>, describes it perfectly when <a href=""https://hbr.org/2013/07/cios-must-lead-outside-of-it/"">she writes that the CIO needs to lead inside and outside the IT organization</a>. The organization <strong><em>wants</em></strong> the CIO to lead innovation via technology and systems. The organization <strong><em>wants</em></strong> the CIO and IT group to be at the leading edge of everything that touches technology. The organization wants the CIO and IT group to take the lead.

The only person really keeping the CIO sidelined is the CIO themselves. They are also the only person that can get themselves off the sideline and back into the game. The CIO needs to take the lead in all things technology. They need to step in front of every project that touches technology (including shadow IT) and offer their assistance. They shouldn’t try to derail these projects; they should offer any and all help that can be provided from the IT group.

One of the most important ways the CIO can get back in the game is to take a look at their data center(s). The data center is, arguably, one of the largest issues the sidelined CIO can address to provide additional value to the organization, especially if the data center is still being operated using old operational methods and techniques. Working on making the data center more agile, efficient and optimized can help make the CIO and IT group more of a leader in the eyes of the organization.

There’s no reason for a CIO to remain sidelined. <a href=""http://www.cio.com/article/2380234/cio-role/state-of-the-cio-2014-the-great-schism.html"">2014 CIO State of the CIO Survey</a> has a few suggestions for CIO’s who find themselves in this predicament. They are:
<ul>
	<li>Focus on building relationships across the enterprise.</li>
	<li>CIO’s must take a leadership role within the organization and help drive business innovation, strategy and cultivate partnerships.</li>
	<li>Ensure that every project is a business project, not a technology project.</li>
	<li>Force the IT organization to become more focused on the business and the customer. Work with your clients to make sure you are able to help with their problems. Listen to what your internal and external clients are looking for and find ways to deliver on their needs.</li>
	<li>Reimagine and reorganize the IT group to ensure agility and flexibility to deliver at the speed of business, not the speed of technology.</li>
	<li>Take a look at your data center to make sure you are able to deliver new services quickly and efficiently. Investigate the use of cloud, converged infrastructure and mobility solutions to ensure that you’ll be able to deliver the services the organization needs today and tomorrow.</li>
</ul>
Being sidelined can be a difficult thing for a CIO (or any leader), but there are ways to get off the sideline and back into the game.

These CIO’s will point to the growing role of marketing and the CMO in selecting and managing technology systems and solutions.  These CIO's will talk about the 'good old days' when the role of the CIO was the end-all-be-all for technology and IT.

These same CIO's talk about how they are always trying to get in front of marketing's projects to slow them down, take them over or stop them. These CIO's also spend a good portion of their time pushing their agenda and trying to rest control of budgets and projects from all areas of the business.

I tend to get a bit aggravated while talking to these types of CIO's.  For some reason, they've decided that they don't like having someone else 'play' in the technology field and are doing everything they can to make things difficult for the CMO, marketing and the rest of the organization.   Rather than embrace the new world that exists, these CIO's are trying to hold on to the way they used to do things.

The marketing group's ownership of digital has been growing for years and will continue to grow over the next few years. <a title=""Gartner Survey Reveals Digital Marketing Budgets Will Increase By 10 Percent in 2014"" href=""http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2723817"" target=""_blank"">Gartner predicts that by the year 2017</a>, the CMO and the marketing group will spend more on IT and technology than the CIO and the IT group. That really scares some folks who are used to the 'old' ways where the CIO and IT group was the one-stop-shop for all things technology.
<h4>Stop Complaining and Start Leading</h4>
My good friend Gene De Libero recently wrote about the migration from the CIO's ownership of technology to the CMO and marketing group's involvement with of technology and ownership of digital. <a title=""Transforming IT Into a Customer-oriented Organization"" href=""https://medium.com/@GeneDeLibero/transforming-it-into-a-customer-oriented-organization-b9e4c99e907b"" target=""_blank"">He wrote</a>:
<blockquote>This shouldn’t alienate CIOs. Instead, they should embrace this driver of digital transformation by partnering with the chief digital teams. The CIO should understand there’s a very relevant role to play in terms of addressing both the stated and unstated needs of their customers. To accomplish this, the CIO must develop a comprehensive and authoritative view of all the customers IT serves across the enterprise.</blockquote>
Well said Gene.

Rather than sit around and complain about their 'demise', CIO's should take Gene's advice and step up and take a leadership role within the organization. The role of the CIO is still as relevant today as it was in the future...and I'd argue that the CIO's role today is even more important than it was in years past.  Ian Cox, author of <a title=""Distrupt IT on Amazon (affiliate link)"" href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ICPWVYI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00ICPWVYI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=edbholdings-20&amp;linkId=YCIC5C2VHZN2UCXJ"" target=""_blank"">Disrupt IT</a>, agrees in a recent post titled ""<a title=""Are CIOs being squeezed out?"" href=""http://thecioleader.com/2014/12/08/are-cios-being-squeezed-out/"" target=""_blank"">Are CIO's being squeezed?</a>"" when he writes:
<blockquote>But I disagree. Far from being a sign that the CIO role is diminishing in importance, the growth in technology expenditure across the rest of the business makes the CIO even more important and influential. But it is a different type of CIO role, supported by a different type of IT function. Rather than being the gatekeeper of the technology budget and the provider of all technology used by the business, the new type of CIO and IT function act as brokers, providing advice, guidance and access to the technology required by the rest of the business.</blockquote>
Nicely said...and very true.

The fact that the organization is turning toward technology more today should mean that the CIO's role should grow in stature and responsibilities.   The role of the CIO is no longer about keeping things 'locked down' with systems, processes and acting as a gatekeeper. The CIO role of today (and tomorrow) should be more strategic and less operational.

A few years ago, I wrote about the changing role of IT in a post titled ""<a title=""Splitting IT – Operations and Innovation"" href=""http://ericbrown.com/splitting-it-operations-innovation.htm"" target=""_blank"">Spitting IT - Operations and Innovation</a>."" In that post, I argue for the splitting of IT into 'operational' and 'strategic' arms.  This idea makes even more sense today. Organizations are already heading down this path today...its just up to the CIO to ensure the IT group plays a part in innovation and strategy and they aren't relegated to the back room in the world of operations.

The CIO should be seen as a leader for all things digital within the organization. This doesn't mean the CIO should own all digital projects and budgets, it just means they should be involved in a consultative role to ensure technology solutions fit into the organization's strategic technology plan.

CIO's shouldn't spend their time bemoaning their current predicament. They should see it as an opportunity to reshape their job, their career and the roles that the IT group can play within the organization.",20141211,http://ericbrown.com/woe-cio.htm,Featured|Information Technology|Leadership|The New CIO,CIO|CMO|Leadership
9019,The Role of the CEO - Driving Corporate Culture,"<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ceodef61-crop-600x338.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-9021"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ceodef61-crop-600x338-300x169.jpg"" alt=""The role of the CEO"" width=""300"" height=""169"" /></a>I'm sure there are many definitions of a CEO out there. Plenty of people will say the CEO should be a leader, manager, communicator and facilitator.  Other's might say that the CEO is the person most focused on strategy and the 'future' of the business.

<a title=""Definition of the CEO"" href=""http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/ceo.asp"" target=""_blank"">Investopedia defines the CEO</a> as:
<blockquote>The highest ranking executive in a company whose main responsibilities include developing and implementing high-level strategies, making major corporate decisions, managing the overall operations and resources of a company, and acting as the main point of communication between the board of directors and the corporate operations. The CEO will often have a position on the board, and in some cases is even the chair.</blockquote>
Not a bad definition of the role. It does highlight the main functions of a CEO...but I'd like to add some commentary about the role of the CEO that isn't highlighted in  that definition or in most definitions of CEO that I've found.

The one addition that I would add to the definition? Culture.

The CEO must be the owner and driver of corporate culture.  If <a title=""company culture competitive advantage"" href=""https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=company%20culture%20competitive%20advantage"" target=""_blank"">culture is an important aspect of the competitive advantage</a> for a business, the ownership of the company's culture must live with the CEO.

If you want your business to be 'customer focused', that needs to be the main focus of your organization's culture. You can't just say to your front-line people that they should be focused on the customer...you have to live and breath 'customer focus.'   If you want your business to be 'agile', you've got to ensure everything about your business screams ""agility"".

Recently, Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, was asked about his role these days. His answer? He focus on culture.  <a title=""I Asked Jeff Bezos About The Tough Questions — No Profits, The Book Controversies, The Phone Flop — And He Showed Why Amazon Is Such A Huge Success  Read more: http://www.businessinsider.com/amazons-jeff-bezos-on-profits-failure-succession-big-bets-2014-12#ixzz3Lyx2Jkje"" href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/amazons-jeff-bezos-on-profits-failure-succession-big-bets-2014-12#ixzz3LsyNEV2V"" target=""_blank"">The full response was</a>:
<blockquote>My main job today: I work hard at helping to maintain the culture. A culture of high standards of operational excellence, of inventiveness, of willingness to fail, willingness to make bold experiments. I’m the counterbalance to the institutional ""no"" who can say ""yes."" I’m not going to be here forever. Many of the traits that make Amazon unusual are now deeply ingrained in the culture. In fact, if I wanted to change them, I couldn’t. The cultures are self-reinforcing, and that’s a good thing</blockquote>
Here we see the guy that started Amazon saying that his main goal isn't making day-to-day decisions on operations (although he does chime in when he needs to) but his main job is maintaining and driving the company's culture.

A company's culture is pervasive and requires leadership from 'on high' like that provided by Bezos. One of the most important role's of the CEO is to help drive and shape corporate culture. Sure, the other stuff is important as well, but without a culture that fits the business strategy, your business might just spin its wheels.",20141215,http://ericbrown.com/role-ceo-driving-corporate-culture.htm,Leadership|Management,CEO|Leadership
9030,Demystifying IT,"<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/head_scratching.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-9034"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/head_scratching-300x201.jpg"" alt=""head_scratching"" width=""300"" height=""201"" /></a>In a recent ""Movers and Shakers"" article by Martha Heller titled ""<a title=""The Power of Metaphor"" href=""http://www.cio.com/article/2860698/leadership-management/the-power-of-metaphor.html?_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_0uuJEV_sn7crbIJNm_EGDgXwfIuqfI3GE7C5pTEJTZUPOAjpJSMrFzRhvY-mHfxFugXSX4a-mZ3Zee8dyBS5M81hBaQ&amp;_hsmi=15326194&amp;utm_content=buffer7e7c0&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer"" target=""_blank"">The Power of Metaphor</a>"", Malini Balakrishnan, CIO of Building Materials Holdings Corporation (BMC) claimed that one of the most important roles that a CIO has today is helping the organization uunderstandwhat role the IT group plays.

Balakrishnan is quoted as saying:
<blockquote>“As CIOs, we need to demystify IT. When current business executives were coming up through the ranks, technology was not as pervasive as it is today so they were able to achieve success without having an understanding of it....How do you explain to a wide range of people what IT is, what role the department plays, and how our work relates to them?”</blockquote>
Ten years ago (and maybe even five years ago), I don't think you'd find very many CIO's who were talking about 'explaining IT to the business.'  Most were focused on their role as controller and manager of technology and information.

The days of old are gone. People within most businesses have figured out how technology works and how they can use technology within their businesses. Most marketing organizations today have taken the initiative to 'own' their technological future. The role of the <a title=""marketing technologist"" href=""http://chiefmartec.com/2013/12/marketing-technologist-neo-marketing-matrix/"" target=""_blank"">marketing technologis</a>t is one that has grown from an idea to a reality within just a few short years.  Gartner has predicted that by the year 2017, the <a href=""http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2723817"" target=""_blank"">CMO will spend more on technology than the CIO will</a>.

The fact that the CMO and marketing group seems to be getting all the love these days makes some <a title=""The Sidelined CIO"" href=""http://ericbrown.com/sidelined-cio.htm"" target=""_blank"">CIO's today feel hampered or sidelined</a> by the fact that they aren't 'in charge' of all technology projects and initiatives within an organization.  Some CIO's are spending their days <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/woe-cio.htm"" target=""_blank"">complaining and whining about their current situation</a>, when in fact they should see it as an opportunity to step up and lead their company through a very interesting time of change.

As I wrote in ""<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/woe-cio.htm"" target=""_blank"">Woe the CIO!(?)</a>"":
<blockquote>CIO’s shouldn’t spend their time bemoaning their current predicament. They should see it as an opportunity to reshape their job, their career and the roles that the IT group can play within the organization.</blockquote>
Nowadays, the CIO should be spending their time working with the people within their organization to help the company understand the value of proper management of technology. CIO's should be spending their time demystifying IT.

In years past, many within IT loved the fact that their jobs were a 'mystery'. They loved the fact that nobody else in the company could do what they did. They loved the fact that everyone had to come to them to get anything done with technology.   We all know how that has played out over the years. We've seen the <a title=""Shadow It"" href=""http://ericbrown.com/?s=shadow+it"" target=""_blank"">proliferation of Shadow IT</a> over the past few years and now we see the CMO and marketing groups 'taking over' the budget for technology.

The role of IT and the CIO is changing from what it used to be. Companies no longer want a 'controller' of information and technology....they want a leader who can help them understand and use technology to deliver value and help innovate. Companies want someone to help demystify IT.",20141218,http://ericbrown.com/demystifying.htm,Featured|Leadership|The New CIO,CIO|CMO|Leadership

I've had this particular write-up in my 'draft' folder for quite some time and is a by-product of a quick write-up that I created for a client a few years ago. This isn't a full review of the book but more of a synopsis of the main topics found within the book.

If you have an interested in decision support, judgement, perception, bias or heuristics I'd recommend you pick up a copy for yourself.
<h3>Summary of the Book</h3>
This book provides an introduction to the judgment and decision making theories that have been developed over the years. The book does a good job of introducing topics like decision making, memory, context, perception, heuristics and bias. This book is perfect for non-psychologists to use as an introductory text on the subject and can act as reference material anyone designing research projects.

The book is broken down into Six Sections with each section introducing new concepts and providing case studies to help solidify the concepts in the reader’s mind. These sections are listed below and described in more detail throughout the remainder of this paper.
<ul>
	<li>Section One – Perceptions, Memory and Context</li>
	<li>Section Two – How Questions Affect Answers</li>
	<li>Section Three – Models of Decision Making</li>
	<li>Section Four – Heuristics and Biases</li>
	<li>Section Five – The Social Side of Judgment and Decision Making</li>
	<li>Section Six – Common Traps</li>
</ul>
<h3>Section One – Perceptions, Memory and Context</h3>
The first section covers a considerable amount of material throughout its 32 pages.   Topics covered in this section include hindsight, perception, context and memory with examples provided to try to illustrate the various topics. I found this section to be slightly over-arching in its topics and after completing the section, the topics weren’t as clear to me as I would have liked. I felt as if the author was trying to cover too much material in too little space.

The introduction and description of the halo effect was the one topic that was the most interesting from this section. The Halo effect, which is an example of context dependence, is a topic that many people in research and industry should be aware of because it shows that the way people to stimuli is dependant on the context that the stimulus is received (Plous, 1993). This topic, which was covered extensively in the book <a title=""The Halo Effect"" href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NY128M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000NY128M&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=edbholdings-20&amp;linkId=34TIG43A34DTRWLE"" target=""_blank"">The Halo Effect</a> by Philip Rosenzweig, is an interesting concept and one that many people fall victim too. Rosenzweig's book is not an academic foray into the world of psychology but does provide some excellent examples of how cognitive bias and context dependence can cloud the judgment of many intelligent people (Rosenzweig, 2007).
<h3>Section Two – How Questions Affect Answers</h3>
This section covers some very interesting topics from the order of questions, wording of questions and the framing of questions and how they might influence the results obtained from those questions. These topics are extremely important to researchers since the way questions are worded and/or asked can influence the results of the research.

Examples and case studies are provided to help the reader understand how questions affect answers. For example, an example is given in Chapter 5 that shows how the ordering of questions has an affect on the results. This example, which was taken from research performed by Schuman and Presser (1981), shows that the order of questions in a survey has an affect on the results of the survey (Plous, 1993; Schuman &amp; Presser, 1981)

The concepts described in this section are arguably some of the most important issues for any researcher to understand as they will need to be taken into consideration when designing survey questions to be used in research.
<h3>Section Three – Models of Decision Making</h3>
This section covers the various models that have been developed to described the decision making process. Models such as Expected Utility Theory and Prospect Theory are described and examples are given to help the reader understand the models.

Chapter 9: Descriptive Models and Decision Making is one of the more interesting chapters in this book. This chapter provides an introduction and explanation of the Prospect Theory of decision making. Prospect theory is a more descriptive model than the expected utility theory and provides methods to model real world scenarios rather than the optimal solutions that are modeled with the expected utility theory. This theory differs greatly from expected utility theory by predicting that a person’s “preference will depend on how a problem is framed” (Plous, 1993).
<h3>Section Four – Heuristics and Biases</h3>
Section four covers two basic, but important, topics: (1) the processes that people use to make decisions and; (2) the biases that result from these processes. The process by which people use to make decisions is said to contain the use of rules of thumb, otherwise known as heuristics. Heuristics are believed to yield fairly good estimates but can lead to bias in the decision making process. This section attempts to cover the well known heuristics and biases. Some examples of these are: representativeness heuristic, availability heuristic, probability and risk, anchoring, perception of randomness, and attribution theory.

This section covers a lot of material with a considerable number of examples. I didn’t feel as though the section was well-connected and seemed to try to cover more material than needed.
<h3>Section Five – The Social Side of Judgment and Decision Making</h3>
This section covers the social factors that affect judgment and decision making. The theme of this section can be summed up fairly easily with the following sentence: people are social animals and their judgment and decision making processes are affected by social influence.

Chapter 17 provides an interesting overview of how society affects an individual’s decision making process and judgment with such topics as social facilitation, social loafing, diffusion of responsibility, conformity and groupthink. Chapter 18 takes a look at the issue from the group’s perspective and compares the decision making performance of a group to the performance by individuals.

The section on groupthink (Chapter 17, page 203) is one of the most interesting parts of this section. Groupthink is a problem in many organizations and is difficult to combat and prevent but this section provides some interesting warning signs and measures to fight groupthink.
<h3>Section Six – Common Traps</h3>
This last section of the book provides an overview of traps that people and organizations commonly fall into. The author lists three major traps: (1) Overconfidence; (2) Self-Fulfilling Prophecies and; (3) Behavioral Traps. Each of these traps is given their own chapter and each is described fairly well with examples used to clarify where needed. The author tries to describe these traps and attempts to provide methods to avoid these traps, but most of these avoidance methods seem to be a little to simplistic.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
Unlike other books on the topic, this book does not provide (nor purport to provide) a ‘how to’ for decision making and/or judgment processes, which I think this is a great thing. This book provides background information at a high level for non-psychology majors to use to better understand the decision making and judgment process.

Section Two: How Questions Affect Answers is one of the most informative sections in this book. If a reader read only this section of the book, they would be in a much better position to understand how surveys are conducted and why some surveys are conducted in the manner in which they are.

This book is a short, well-written overview on most topics and should be required reading for all researchers and students.

9054,Building the Agile Data Center,"<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/computer-data-center.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-9056"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/computer-data-center-300x169.jpg"" alt=""computer-data-center"" width=""300"" height=""169"" /></a>The modern data center is a complex environment with many different systems and many different objectives. The data center exists to provide an organization with the networking, storage, processing and connectivity features needed to operate in the fast paced, data-driven world we live in today.

Over the years, many data centers have become the dumping ground for all things technology. Systems and applications were continuously added to the data center to the point where many data centers were completely full with no room for add new hardware to support growing needs for processing, storage and network capabilities.

Many organizations have been undergoing data center consolidation projects in recent years. These consolidation projects have resulted in data centers being closed down and services and platforms being moved into other data centers within the organization. As expected, these projects have added to already overburdened data centers but virtualization has again provided real value to the business and the data center by allowing many physical servers to be combined into a virtualized environment.

The use of virtualized environments has led many organizations to look for other ways to use virtualization within their data centers. That search has led many companies to research and implement Software Defined Data Centers (SDDC) as a way to replace or augment their existing data center infrastructure.   With SDDC, it is possible for companies to replace their data center’s infrastructure with a virtualized environment and then deliver services and software as a service.

There’s some obvious benefits found with a software defined approach to the data center. Organizations can remove underutilized servers, replace aging networking and storage systems and improve / increase security. SDDC allows organizations to replace aging systems with new systems which may be easier to manage and maintain.

There are other benefits to SDDC that may not be that obvious. A few of these benefits include more flexibility within the data center, closer integration with cloud systems and vendors and easier change management when changes are needed within the data center. Having the ability to define the entire data center infrastructure allows to companies to move their data center systems and technologies at the speed of business. When new services are required by the business, the IT group can quickly make the necessary changes within the data center to provide that new service or offering.

Another benefit of SDDC is that it allows companies to spend less on hardware for the data center. Of course, hardware will still be needed for SDDC but the hardware won’t be the infrastructure itself. Hardware will simply be the delivery system for the software defined data center. With SDDC, hardware is simply a commodity that can be swapped in and out as needed. Using commodity hardware for all aspects of the data center allows companies to save a great deal of money within the data center.

When I speak with clients about the software defined data center, the one benefit that the majority of people tend to really latch onto is the ability of SDDC to bring agility to the data center. A few weeks ago, I wrote a post titled <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/agile-data-center.htm"">The Agile Data Center</a> that touches on the subject of the agility in the data center. In that post, I wrote:
<blockquote>“Agility doesn’t necessarily mean new systems nor does it mean moving your data center to the cloud. It does mean thinking about your data center and your data center capabilities in new ways and then putting in new processes (and perhaps, new systems) to make the data center flexible and agile.”</blockquote>
As I wrote, converting the data center from inflexible and overburdened to agile and able to grow requires new thinking. That new thinking can come from the software defined data center approach. Not only does SDDC allow an organization to rethink the data center but it also allows the data center to become an agile platform for the company to use to design and build agile services for internal and external consumption.

SDDC isn’t the answer to every data center problem, but it is an approach that can be used to bring agility to the data center.

9060,IBM's Four Ways to Innovate using Big Data,"<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/big-data-ecommerce.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-9062"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/big-data-ecommerce-300x169.jpg"" alt=""Keyboard with Big Data Button."" width=""300"" height=""169"" /></a>I just read through ""<a title=""Four Ways To Innovate Using Big Data And Analytics"" href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/ibm/2014/12/08/four-ways-to-innovate-using-big-data-and-analytics/"" target=""_blank"">Four Ways to Innovate Using Big Data and Analytics</a>"" over on Forbes. It's a good read...you should jump over and read it yourself.

If you don't have the time (or just don't want to), I give my thoughts on these 'four ways"" below.

The 'four ways' are:
<ol>
	<li>The payback on big data investments is happening quickly</li>
	<li>Businesses are increasingly using big data to solve operational challenges</li>
	<li>Organizations are reinventing business processes using digital tech</li>
	<li>Velocity, not volume, is driving the impact of big data</li>
</ol>
Before I dive into my thoughts, I have to point out that these 'four ways' are really only three as #1 above is really just informational.  I could also argue that #4 is mostly another informational tidbit (and one could argue that #2 and #3 are really the same thing) but I won't get that picky here.

The fact that many companies are seeing payback on big data investments is wonderful. The article reports on an <a href=""http://www-935.ibm.com/services/us/gbs/thoughtleadership/2014analytics/"" target=""_blank"">IBM survey that shows</a> payback is happening very quickly with ""<em>some 63 percent of companies surveyed are seeing a return within a year, and 26 percent are getting a payback in six month</em>."" That's impressive, considering many organizations I've worked with and spoke to have no clear idea on how to calculate ROI or payback on big data initiatives when they first begin researching those initiatives.

I do love the fact that companies are using big data to solve operational challenges. That's one of the real areas of value that you can easily point at and say ""we saved X dollars or Y percent due to operational changes due to big data and analytics.""  One of the examples given in the article for this innovative approach is <a href=""http://www.antheminc.com/"" target=""_blank"">Wellpoint's</a> use of big data to ""<em>make more effective decisions about approving medical procedures and getting patients the care they need more quickly</em>."" Wellpoint's new system can reportedly '<em>provide responses to requests for urgent pre-authorization in seconds instead of 72 hours</em>.' That's pretty impressive.

I also love the fact that companies are reinventing business processes using digital tech, big data and analytics.  Companies are using all sorts of data collected from many different locations (e.g., social, mobile, cloud, etc) and then using that data to cut costs, create new services and products and increase revenue.  Solving operational challenges is basically the same thing as reinventing business processes. That said, there's value in using data and analytics and applying them to your entire business to see if there is any improvements you can find.

The last item isn't exactly an innovative 'way' to use big data but it is an extremely important thing for every organization to consider. Companies not only need to think about the 'volume' of data that they're analyzing...they also need to think about the velocity of the data as it is collected and analyzed. The article again points to an IBM <a href=""http://www-935.ibm.com/services/us/gbs/thoughtleadership/2014analytics/"" target=""_blank"">survey</a> that claims ""<em>nearly three quarters of respondents say demand for data-driven insights will accelerate during the next 12 to 18 months</em>."" Not only are we collecting more data today then ever before, but we are collecting and analyzing more data at a much faster rate then ever before.

Data analysis is no longer just about the about the size or type of data but about how fast that data can be converted from bits and bytes into useful information for the business. If your organization can quickly and efficiently convert your data into useful, informative and innovative knowledge you'll be ahead of the big data game.",20141229,http://ericbrown.com/ibms-four-ways-innovate-using-big-data.htm,Big Data|The New CIO,Big Data|data analytics|Innovation

In October 2014, I successfully defended my dissertation titled ""Analysis of Twitter Messages for Sentiment and Insight for use in Stock Market Decision Making."" This dissertation was the final step in earning more D.Sc. in Information Systems.

In my dissertation, I reported on my research into using natural language processing (NLP) to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter messages. This sentiment is then analyzed to determine if this sentiment can be used for stock market investing decisions using the idea of the <a href=""https://tradethesentiment.com/features"" target=""_blank"">Bear/Bull ratio</a> which is a quantitative measure of sentiment from Twitter. The research conducted for my dissertation is the baseline for the services on this website.

They are:
<ul>
	<li>Not knowing yourself.</li>
	<li>Not communicating well.</li>
	<li>Inability to communicate the business value of IT.</li>
	<li>Not being organized.</li>
</ul>
These are definite malfunctions but they are 'fixable'.  Joe provides some good advice on how to go about resolving these particular malfunctions. I won't rehash his solutions here but I recommend you <a title=""The Four Malfunctions of a CIO"" href=""http://blog.hellersearch.com/blog/the-four-malfunctions-of-a-cio"" target=""_blank"">jump over and read them yourself</a>.

I shared Joe's post earlier today via Twitter and quickly had a great question from <a title=""Zach Gonzales"" href=""https://twitter.com/zack_g"" target=""_blank"">@zach_g</a> about any 'additions' that I'd add to the article.  I was already thinking about writing something but Zach pushed me over the edge to get this post published.  Thanks Zach! :)

While I agree with Joe's ""malfunctions"", there's a few more that I'd like to add to the list.  They are listed below and a discussion of each follows.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Not understanding the user base within your organization.</strong>  This is a difficult thing to 'solve', but it is a must for any CIO to address.  If the CIO (or IT) doesn't truly understand the users within the organization, no technology solution can possibly deliver what the business needs.</li>
	<li><strong>Focusing on the 'solution' over the 'problem.'</strong>  Many times, we within IT tend to focus on the solution rather than the larger problem we are asked to solve. We call something 'complete' once we've met a set of requirements and then we move on to the next solution to implement. We move from one project to the next without looking at the bigger picture of the business, which includes the larger business problems that cannot be solve with piecemeal solutions.</li>
	<li><strong>Not pushing 'agility' as a core capability of IT</strong>.  The modern (and future) IT group must be an agile one. It's no longer good enough to focus on processes and systems and keeping the lights on...the IT group has got to be able to work at the pace of business today, which is <em>not</em> the pace that we are used to working within the IT group.  Agility will bring rapid change for the better to both the IT group and the organization as a whole.</li>
</ul>

Who are you?"" href=""http://blogs.gartner.com/michael_maoz/2015/01/08/cios-can-be-supply-specialists-or-maestros-of-innovation-who-are-you/"" target=""_blank"">CIOs can be supply specialists or maestros of innovation. Who are you?</a>""   The question is implied within the title of the post but I'll paraphrase it here for the benefit of discussion.  The paraphrased question is ""<em>Are you a Supply Chain CIO or a Strategic CIO</em>""?

When I say ""Supply Chain CIO"", I'm not talking about your industry...I'm talking about your approach to the role as technology leader within your organization.  Are you an order taker that does whatever the 'purchase order' says? Are you a logistics manager who just pushes orders around the data center?

Or...are you a Strategic CIO who is helping to lead business initiatives within your organization?

As a supply chain CIO, you're helping the operational side of the business tremendously. You are ensuring that the lights are staying on, the data center is running efficiently and technology is available to help the business. As a supply chain CIO, you and your team are known as the 'tech team' and are brought in when something needs to be implemented or 'fixed'.

There's no question that the supply chain CIO brings value to the organization. Every company needs someone to drive operational efficiency. Every company needs someone to make sure technology is being managed for optimum performance.  That said, companies don't need a CIO to focus on the operational side of things. There are plenty of other people within IT who can focus on operations. The CIO needs to be strategic in their thinking and in their actions.

As a strategic CIO, you're helping the whole business, not just the operational aspects of the business. You're helping direct the organization's use of technology to solve the business problems and add business value. You're driving your team to focus on the user and the client and not on the technology itself. As a strategic CIO, you are and your team are known as the 'problem solving' team brought in to help your organization think about how to solve business problems and deliver business value through the use of technology.

If you are struggling to define yourself as a CIO, make sure you push yourself into the strategic planning aspects of the role. Make sure you keep yourself and your team focused on the business problems and the users that are affected by those problems. If you can't (or won't) become the strategic CIO your company needs, you may find yourself as a <a title=""The Sidelined CIO"" href=""http://ericbrown.com/sidelined-cio.htm"" target=""_blank"">Sidelined CIO</a> in the not too distant future.",20150112,http://ericbrown.com/supply-chain-cio-vs-strategic-cio.htm,Featured|Strategy|The New CIO,CIO|Strategy

The article, which reports on a survey by Alsbridge, claims that many businesses today are focused on cutting internal costs rather than looking at outsourced providers and services for cost savings.

<a href=""http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/outsourcing/3590995/businesses-prefer-cut-in-house-costs-than-challenge-providers-of-outsourced-services/"" target=""_blank"">According to the article</a>, ""<em>managers are reluctant to question service providers because the multi-vendor ecosystems they have built are too delicate to tamper with and too big to fail. Instead, businesses looking to cut costs are focusing 'excessively' on in-house labour costs</em>.""

Seems a bit strange doesn't it...only looking internally for cost savings?  If you are looking to cut costs, wouldn't you want to take a look at your entire operation to look for efficiency gains and places for savings?

According to the article, the reason companies aren't able or willing to look at outside vendors is due to the complexity of the services those vendors provide and the intermingling between multiple vendor's services and systems.  I realize modern organization's are complex and the technology infrastructure to support these organizations is also complex, but complexity shouldn't be a reason for not doing something.

I can't think of a single argument that any CIO or IT leader (or any business leader) could make that would convince me that they shouldn't look at every single aspect of their operation to identify places for cost savings.  I can't imagine any level of complexity that would keep me from looking at every aspect of the business for places to save money.

Ian writes that CIO’s need to better understand the New role of the CIO and follow a new model. He writes:
<blockquote>In this new model, rather than being the gatekeeper of the technology budget and the provider of all technology used by the business, the new type of CIO and IT function act as brokers, providing advice, guidance and access to the technology required by the rest of the business. <em><strong>It is a far more important and valuable role but it requires a different type of CIO and a different type of IT function.</strong></em></blockquote>
Emphasis mine.

There are some CIO’s out there that have embraced the changing landscape of IT. These CIO’s have figured out that their future lies within a collaborative environment with other groups within the organization. They’ve realized that groups like Marketing and the Chief Marketing Officer have been increasing their technological knowledge exponentially over the last few years. They’ve realized that the future of the IT group and their future as CIO lies within their ability to help lead technology solutions within a company without having to ‘own’ that technology or the budget for that technology. I’ve given these CIO’s a new moniker. <em>They are New CIO’s</em>.

While these CIO’s have figured out the future of their role and the IT group is changing, there are many other CIO’s who’ve yet to figure it out - or at least have yet to accept that changes are coming (or have already arrived). These second types of CIO’s are looking for ways to get their ‘old’ lives back. They're looking for ways to own all technology budgets, projects and systems and are constantly fighting the CMO and others to regain the control they once had. Just like the New CIO’s, I’ve given this second type of CIO a moniker as well. <em>They are Old CIO’s</em>.

I know...I know...not very interesting names for either, but stick with me in this journey and you’ll see they are perfect monikers for the two types of thinking. Not only do they perfectly describe the difference between the two types of CIO’s I see today but the monikers describe the difference in the types of thinking that is required of CIO’s to build the digital organization of the future.

Throughout my career, I’ve generally found myself at the intersection of business strategy and technology.  I've spent many years working as a consultant to CIO’s, CMO’s and other’s within many different types of organizations. I’ve worked with large and small companies and IT groups from one to one-thousand people.

Over the course of my career, I’ve watched many companies struggle with technology and technology management. I’ve watched companies languish in the Old way of thinking and I’ve watched companies grow revenues exponentially with new thinking.  I’ve watched companies shrink and layoff staff because they just couldn’t move away from Old thinking. I’ve watched other companies grow their technological systems and capabilities while keeping staffing levels fairly constant with New thinking approaches.

I think the New CIO and the New IT group can bring a more value to an organization than any other part of the business. As CIO, you can continue doing things the way you used to or you can reimagine your role and the role of your team plays within the organization and deliver more value to the business than ever before.

I’ve heard some people say that the IT group (and the CIO) are irrelevant in today’s world. I disagree. The New CIO can make IT and the CIO role more relevant than ever before.",20150120,http://ericbrown.com/new-cio-revisited.htm,Featured|The New CIO,Business|CIO|Strategy
9126,Perceptions Matter - CIO's Take Note,"CIO Magazine has released their ""<a title=""2015 State of the CIO"" href=""http://www.cio.com/article/2862760/cio-role/2015-state-of-the-cio.html"" target=""_blank"">2015 State of the CIO</a>"" report.  I look forward to this report every year as it provides some great insight into the minds of CIO's and the roles they are playing within their businesses.

This year's report has some great content but I wanted to point out one particular aspect of the report related to 'perceptions' of the CIO and IT group.  In the slide below - taken from the<a title=""2015 State of the CIO"" href=""http://www.cio.com/article/2862760/cio-role/2015-state-of-the-cio.html"" target=""_blank"">2015 State of the CIO</a> report - results of questions related to how business leaders perceive the IT group within their organization are provided.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-9127 size-full"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot-2015-01-21-13.19.18.png"" alt=""State of the CIO for 2015"" width=""626"" height=""460"" />

For a small minority (13%), the IT group and the CIO are seen as business leaders. These are the CIO's and IT groups who've figured out how to work in the 'New' world of business. These are the teams that view themselves as solvers of business problems, not technology problems. Another 30% of the respondents see the IT group and the CIO as business partners. I'm actually pretty excited to see such a large number.

There's a disheartening aspect to these results though with 43% of respondents calling their CIO's and IT groups business partners or business leaders. The majority of respondents (56%) see their IT groups as a necessary part of the business but not something that truly creates lasting value for the business or the clients of the business. With 18% of respondents perceiving IT as a cost center and 38% viewing the IT group and/or CIO as a service provider, we see that many companies still view IT as just a budgetary line item rather than a real, value-driven part of the business.

I'm sure there are plenty of CIO's and IT professionals who believe they are more than a cost center or service provider, but based on the respondents in this survey, the majority of those folks would be wrong.   I wonder how many CIO's out there would put themselves in the 'cost center' or 'service provider' bucket if they were asked?

Perception matters. How is your IT group viewed by your organization?

9138,Secrets to Big Data Success?,"<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/no-secrets-480.gif""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-9139"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/no-secrets-480-300x300.gif"" alt=""Big Data Secrets for Success"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>Last week I was asked whether there were any 'secrets' that companies can follow to ensure success with big data.  My short answer was ""Nope."" My longer answer was something along the lines of ""there aren't any secrets, just lots of work and a little bit of luck.'

Most folks don't like to hear answers like that. Most folks want to hit the 'easy' button and be done with it but there's very little in life that the easy button actually works for. That doesn't stop people from searching for the easy button though.

In what I thought was another blog post purporting to point to the easy button, I was pleasantly surprised to read <a title=""Seven secrets to big data project success"" href=""http://searchcio.techtarget.com/opinion/Seven-secrets-to-big-data-project-success"" target=""_blank"">Seven secrets to big data project success over</a> on SearchCIO this morning. While I thought the article was going to really push for the 'easy' button, it actually does a decent job of describing some of the things that a company can do to set themselves up for success with big data. Their seven 'secrets' are:
<ul>
	<li>Do start small</li>
	<li>Do experiment</li>
	<li>Do pull the trigger on Hadoop</li>
	<li>Do leverage dark data</li>
	<li>Don't give into the R craze</li>
	<li>Don't just report on the data</li>
	<li>Don't think analytics will automatically be adopted</li>
</ul>
While I wouldn't call any of these 'secrets', they are good reminders of things that you can do to get yourself moving in the right direction with your big data initiatives.   I agree with all of the above ""secrets"" except for the ""don't give into the R craze"" ...sometimes it just makes sense to build your own analytics and visualization system, at least when you're starting out.

While the author of the above article called them 'secrets', I'd suggest that they are just 'tips' for working within the big data world.

9144,Does your Disaster Recovery Plan Include the Cloud?,"<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cloud-computing-cable2-595x335.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-9145"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cloud-computing-cable2-595x335-300x169.jpg"" alt=""Disaster Recovery and the Cloud"" width=""300"" height=""169"" /></a>In years past, companies have relied on multiple data center locations to act as their main disaster recovery (DR) systems and data in case of disaster. This has generally worked well for those companies that have planned and tested their DR systems and plans appropriately.

In recent years organizations have been looking for more robust solutions for disaster recovery than storing their data in separate data centers. With the growth in popularity, functionality and capabilities of cloud technology and cloud vendors, CIO’s and IT Managers began to investigate the use of public, private and hybrid cloud systems for disaster recovery solutions.

It’s taken a while for many companies to feel comfortable with the cloud as a platform that is an integral part of their business systems, but most CIO’s and IT professionals have come to terms with the capabilities and impact of cloud technology. While <a title=""The State of Global Disaster Recovery Preparedness"" href=""http://drbenchmark.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ANNUAL_REPORT-DRPBenchmark_Survey_Results_2014_report.pdf"" target=""_blank"">secondary sites still dominate the disaster recovery planning for organizations</a>, cloud deployment of disaster recovery solutions continues to grow. With a cloud DR deployment, companies can ensure geographic diversity for their data and cloud DR can allow a company to use multiple cloud vendors to ensure diversity of networks and systems for building a very robust disaster recovery plan.

Cloud-based disaster recovery makes a lot of sense, but there are still plenty of people worried about moving to the cloud for their DR. Many people get hung up on a few old myths (e.g., downtime doesn't cost that much, disaster recovery means long-term contracts,  etc) that keep them from moving their disaster recovery systems and plans to the cloud while others believe their on-premise DR systems and plans will work just fine.

Cloud-based DR can provide an enormous amount of value to an organization. In the event of a disaster, a cloud-based system can help a company recover quickly and efficiently. Not only can data be stored safely and reliably in the cloud but systems and applications can be replicated in the cloud to allow the organization to bring their systems online quickly after a disaster.

Many clients that I work with have cloud-based disaster recovery systems in place or they’ve put them on their roadmap for the coming years. They’ve been able to look past the myths about the cloud and cloud-based DR and see the value. They see the benefits of the cloud for disaster recovery and have started shifting their disaster recovery planning and budget initiatives to the cloud.

From my experiences talking with CIO’s and other IT leaders, there’s quite a lot of interest in cloud technology these days. Many companies are looking at cloud-based disaster recovery for their next iteration of disaster recovery. Thankfully, people are starting to move past the concerns and myths about the cloud and are seeing it for what it is: a great platform for building agile, flexible and cost-effective solutions for their business.

What about your organization? Does your disaster recovery plan include the cloud?

9147,Building an Agile IT Group,"<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/embracechange.png""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-9151"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/embracechange-300x224.png"" alt=""Building an Agile IT Group"" width=""300"" height=""224"" /></a>Like the data center in most organizations, IT groups have been undergoing a transformation over the last few years. IT leaders have constantly been on the lookout for new systems, technologies, people and skills to meet the ‘do more with less’ mantra while continuing to build out the capabilities required of their teams.

Thankfully, CIO’s have had the good fortune that cloud computing and virtualization were available to help transform IT operations and the data center. Combining these new technologies in innovative ways has allowed organizations to cut costs, improve flexibility and just generally ‘do more with less.’

Virtualization has allowed organizations to expand their data center capabilities without requiring enormous outlays of capital for new hardware and physical space by allowing companies to decommission underutilized servers and replace them with optimized virtualized systems.

Similarly, the cloud has given organizations access to an almost limitless amount of processing and storage power with low costs, relatively high reliability and a great deal of agility. Companies have been able to quickly and efficiently expand data center capabilities with little capital expenditure or long term commitments by turning to cloud vendors and platforms.

Both virtualization and cloud computing have completely transformed data center planning and operations. They’ve also planted the seeds of change within the IT group itself by forcing IT professionals to think more about adding business value rather than narrowly focusing on the technologies they are managing and implementing.

Many organizations have been pushing data center transformation projects while neglecting the transformation of the IT group itself. These companies have transformed (or are working to transform) their data centers from a monolithic, underutilized liability to an agile and valuable asset, but they’ve often failed to push agility as a core concept for IT professionals working within their IT groups.

In order to continue to improve and provide value, CIO’s need to be thinking about their people as well as their technology and systems. They need to think about how to include concepts like agility, business value, cross-training and laser focus on customer satisfaction into the fabric of the IT group.

While I can’t provide a ‘recipe’ for CIO’s to use to create an agile IT group, I have provided a few guidelines that have worked for me (and others) in the past. These guidelines are:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Focus on the User</strong>: Many times, IT is given a set of requirements and they go off to build a system to meet those requirements. Rarely do we take a step back to look at the requirements from the user’s point of view. Rarely do we spend more than a few minutes talking to the actual end users who have commissioned the work. Rarely do we see the stress and strain they are under to do their jobs. A focus on the user will help IT professionals understand the need for agility and flexibility in their jobs.</li>
	<li><strong>Rethink your Operational Delivery Model</strong>: Use the cloud and virtualization to rethink and rebuild your delivery capabilities so that your team can more easily say “yes” when asked for help from the business. If your IT staff can say “yes” easily, it will become second nature for them to continue to say ‘yes’ whenever they can. And saying “yes” is what agility is all about.</li>
	<li><strong>Invest in Skills and Training</strong>: If you want your team to change, you really need to focus on training and skill development to ensure your team has the capabilities and knowledge to perform their jobs in a fast-paced environment like an agile IT group.</li>
	<li><strong>Cultivate and Eliminate</strong>: Cultivate the skills, ethics and abilities that you want to see in your agile team while eliminating those that you don’t. This may mean hiring and firing but not everyone is cut out for an agile IT group so you shouldn’t try to force people to ‘fit.’</li>
</ul>
In order to compete in the future, CIO’s and IT professionals need to remain agile. They’ll need to continue <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/building-agile-data-center.htm"">building the agile data center</a> but they’ll need to also focus on building an agile team to get the most use from the <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/agile-data-center.htm"">agile data center</a>.

9157,The Right Services in the Right Way,"I’ve written a bit about the agile data center lately. I’ve previously defined the <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/agile-data-center.htm"">agile data center</a> as something that “allows organizations to efficiently and effectively add, remove and change services at the speed of the business, not the speed of technology.”

I still stand by that definition but I wanted to expand on it a bit. Agility does allow organizations to ‘add, remove and changes services’ quickly and easily. I recently watched a <a href=""http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/what-agile-data-center"">talk by Symantec’s Jeff Hausman and Drew Meyer</a> that described the agile data center a bit better than my original definition. During Jeff and Drew’s talk, they used a slide (shown below) to help define the agile data center perfectly. They define it as “<em>Delivering the right services...in the right way...to the right user.</em>” (Note: The slide uses 'resources' instead of services...I paraphrased a bit). That’s a perfect definition (and one that I wish I had come up with).

<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Untitled.png""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-9158"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Untitled.png"" alt=""Symantec-Agile-Data-Center"" width=""781"" height=""439"" /></a>

My original definition still stands as it fits well into this new definition but I really like having a focus on the ‘user’ that this new definition brings. By expressly adding the user to the definition, it forces us in IT to keep our users and clients in mind when designing new systems or applications and/or making changes to existing platforms.

<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/building-agile-data-center.htm"">Building (and managing) an agile data center </a>allows the IT group to do exactly what is described in this slide. An agile data center allows the IT group to deliver the right services in the right way at the right time for the right user(s) within the organization.

In addition to the definition itself, the above slide provides some excellent insight into the use of Software Defined Data Center (SDDC) technologies, Platform-As-A-Service (or Software-As-A-Service), agile / elastic infrastructure and ‘metadata’ to help organizations make this new definition a reality. In addition, each ‘sphere’ shown in the image above helps to drive agile thinking within the data center and within the IT group as a whole.

If CIO’s and IT professionals keep this new definition in mind when designing and planning their data centers (and anything else they do for the organization), they’ll quickly earn a reputation as a business solutions team rather than a technology management team.

Delivering the right services at the right time in the right way to the right user is a perfect mantra for each and every IT professional today. Now, they just need to find a way to make that mantra a reality within their organizations by building the idea into everything they do.

Additionally, with this mantra in mind, it becomes much easier to <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/building-agile-data-center.htm"">plan, build and manage the agile data center</a> within the organization.

9162,An Agile Business Needs an Agile IT Group,"<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/agile-employees.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-9163"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/agile-employees-300x200.jpg"" alt=""Agile Employees"" width=""300"" height=""200"" /></a>If you ask any business leader whether they’d prefer that their organization be thought of as ‘slow moving’ or ‘agile’, most would respond with ‘agile’ as their preference.   Those that don’t respond in the affirmative toward agility are most likely running a dying business or are just out of sync with their industry and their organization.

While everyone most likely knows what agility means, let me take as second to define the term and set the stage for the discussion. One of the <a href=""http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/agility"">most common definitions of agility</a> is “nimbleness” or “the power of moving quickly and easily.”

With that definition in mind, think about your own business. Is your business agile? Are you nimble? Does your CEO or top leadership talk about agility or push for an agile mindset in everything you do? If not, you might want to start talking to your leadership team about the importance of agility for businesses today.

I’m not going to dive into why businesses must be agile today. I’ll leave that to the likes of <a href=""http://solutions.forrester.com/business-agility/improve-your-business-agility-187UW-2434YQ.html"">Forrester</a>, <a href=""http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/managing_in_uncertainty/competing_through_organizational_agility"">McKinsey</a> and others. I will only say that I truly believe that every organization must incorporate the idea of ‘agility’ into their culture to be successful long-term. There’s just too much disruption happening in every industry to not be willing and able to quickly and efficiently make decisions and change direction to meet these disruptive forces.

At the heart of every organization’s move to be a more agile business is the IT group. In order for the organization to be agile, the IT group must approach everything they do with agility at the front of their minds.

In order to make decisions quickly, all areas and levels of the business needs access to data and information about the business in ways that makes it easy to consume and use. For many companies, this concept requires a change in thinking from the ‘old’ way of only allowing data to be accessible via specialized IT analysts to allowing access to just about anyone in the organization.

In addition to information accessibility, an agile business needs agility within the data center, which has always been a complex and structured environment. I’ve written about the <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/agile-data-center.htm"">Agile Data Center</a> previously but I’ll reiterate that building agile data center doesn’t mean a complete rebuild with new systems or new people but it <strong><em>does </em></strong>require a changing of the mindset. Processes need to be rebuilt to remove slow moving (and often bureaucratic) thinking and replace them with agile client-focused processes that help the business move quickly and effectively.

An agile business requires an IT group that is just as agile as the business. Agility hasn’t always been the forte of CIO’s and IT groups in the past but the future of the IT group depends on the ability to transform into an efficient, nimble part of the business.

The example provided by Ashkenas is one that I’ve heard and experienced many times myself.  One of his clients implemented a ‘crowdsourcing’ approach to gathering innovation ideas from people throughout their business. This company received so many responses that it took nearly a month for all of the responses to be analyzed, categorized and reviewed.  It then took a few more weeks for executives to respond to everyone and announce that they were planning on following up on specific ideas to pursue.

As I mentioned earlier, I’ve seen this type of thing happen at other organizations I’ve worked at. The urge to identify and implement innovative ideas is a strong driving force for any organization and crowdsourcing these ideas makes a great deal of sense. That said, taking the step of asking for new ideas is pointless if your organization can’t quickly act upon those ideas.

This is why every organization needs to reimagine (or reinvent) itself as an agile organization. To truly be able to act upon innovative ideas, an organization needs to be able to marshal the necessary resources (e.g., people, systems, data, etc) to be able to analyze and act upon these new ideas.

Organizations need to be able to pivot and turn quickly to address their clients needs and their competitors offerings. This agility requires the utmost <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/agile-business-needs-agile-group.htm"">agility in all aspects of the business, including the IT group</a>.  The IT group must provide systems and capabilities to allow the business to gather data, analyze that data and act upon that data quickly and easily.

In the example given by Ashkenas, an agile organization with an agile IT group should be able to put the right tools together capture, track, analyze and report on ideas from around the business.  If your IT group can’t put together the right tools at the right time to deliver the right services, you probably need to spend some time rethinking your IT group and its leadership. Additionally, if your IT group <em><strong>can</strong></em> deliver the right tools at the right time but it still takes you weeks or months to analyze and react...you have larger problems than just a non-agile IT group.",20150204,http://ericbrown.com/dont-ask-cant-act.htm,Organization|People|Strategy|The New CIO,analytics|Crowdsourcing|Leadership

The article, titled ""<a title=""Big Data and the Mirror of Erised"" href=""http://blog.cutter.com/2015/02/10/big-data-mirror/"" target=""_blank"">Big Data and the Mirror of Erised</a>"", Kellen writes:
<blockquote>Being human beings with a tendency to confirm what we so want to have happen or to relive what felt so good in the past, managers often drift into self-sealing and circular analysis that at first doesn’t seem so wrong. <strong>Big data has to poke through the subtle and instinctual responses of data denial.</strong></blockquote>
<strong>Emphasis mine</strong>.

The ability to 'poke through the subtle and instinctual responses of data denial' is one of the differences between 'good' data science and 'poor' data science.  The ability to show people why their bias' are wrong differentiates a good data scientist from poor one.

Fighting confirmation bias in data science is an ongoing issue that must be addressed in every aspect of data analysis.  To make matters worse, just about every person within an organization has some sort of bias that has the possibility of effecting data analysis within the organization.

Kellen writes that ""much stands in the way between data and a good decision, most of that being human nature. If organizational leaders can develop a collective, emerging, and self-guiding process for analyzing data, anything is possible.""

Now...I'm not sure what a ""collective, emerging and self-guiding process"" is exactly, but it sounds good. I think what he's arguing for is that organizations should open up their data to everyone within the organization and then allow that data to speak for itself as much as possible, the possibility of confirmation bias can be reduced.

Kellen provides some interesting ideas to fighting the bias issue.

9185,Use Cases for the Cloud,"<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/7usecasesforcloudDR.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-9187"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/7usecasesforcloudDR-300x225.jpg"" alt=""Cloud Use Cases"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /></a>If you’ve spent any time within IT over the last few years, you’ve probably heard the term ‘cloud’ more than you really wanted to. The cloud has become something of a buzzword over the years.   Buzzwords are created when a term is overused, and the cloud has been overused quite a bit in many organizations. It seems that any time a problem arises, the first solution is to use ‘the cloud’.

IT professionals are usually the first to scoff at buzzwords, mainly because their experiences have shown that buzzwords generally mean more work for them with very little value gained for the organization. That said, when it comes to the cloud, these same folks who turn up their nose at most buzzwords are often the first to look toward the cloud as a solution to their problems because they know that the cloud has generally lived up to the buzz.

The problem with any type of technology buzz is that most people within an organization don’t really understand the ‘use cases’ for that technology. They hear everyone else talking about it just assume it is a platform or system that will work for them.

With this in mind, I wanted to take a second to highlight what I think are the ideal use cases for the cloud. These may not be your ideal use cases (and if they aren’t, I’d love to hear what yours are) but they are what I’ve found work best for me and my clients.
<h3><strong>Use Cases for the Cloud</strong></h3>
In my experiences, there are five main use cases for the cloud. While there may be some overlap in some of these use cases, they are about as high-level as I can make them. The use cases are:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Disaster Recovery </strong>- The cloud makes perfect sense for disaster recovery. It gives an organization an almost instantaneous redundant backup and recovery solution.</li>
	<li><strong>Data Center Extension / Expansion / Replacement </strong>- Many organizations are in the midst of data center transformation projects. These projects include expanding, optimizing and even replacing their data centers. In many instances, the cloud has been driving much of these transformation projects by giving organizations the ability to quickly add capabilities to aging data centers.</li>
	<li><strong>Development &amp; Test Environments</strong> - The cloud makes it very easy to turn on new development and test environments.</li>
	<li><strong>Enterprise Modernization</strong> - Modernization is a fairly large issue in some organizations. They’ve allowed their data centers and other aspects of their infrastructure to grow old and, because of this, they're often unable to quickly deliver new services and solutions for their clients and groups within the business. The cloud allows an organization to modernize and prepare for the future fairly easily and cost-effectively.</li>
	<li><strong>New System Development</strong> - If an organization needs to build a new application or system from the ground up, the cloud is usually at the top of the list for the ‘where’ that app or system will be built.</li>
</ul>
I’d love to hear your thoughts on the use cases for the cloud.

If you don't follow Mark's writing on his <a href=""http://www.switchscribe.com/"" target=""_blank"">blog</a> or <a href=""https://twitter.com/mthiele10"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a>, you should...he has some great insights into IT , IT leadership, the data center and many other aspects of the IT group..

While Mark's entire post is great, I wanted to point out one particular paragraph from Mark's post and make a few comments about it. <a href=""http://www.switchscribe.com/why-we-value-it-incorrectly-innovation-vs-cost-center/"" target=""_blank"">Mark writes that</a>:
<blockquote>Why isn’t IT expected to live up to a higher standard in demonstrating the benefits of projects and being more innovative in applying IT to the task of creating business value? I don’t think IT is expected to live to a higher standard because again, the average C-Suite doesn’t expect anything other than cost and risk management.</blockquote>
I've been asking that question for years. I've asked it at every company I've worked at and asked it of every CIO, CEO, COO and VP I could find.  The answer usually tended to be something along the lines of ""because IT is a cost center"".

What poppycock! (I've been waiting a long time to use 'poppycock).  IT isn't a cost center! Or at least it shouldn't be.

Maybe IT could be called a cost center in the past when IT was just a 'cost of doing business' but not today.Technology IS the backbone of business today and is the driving force behind most of the innovations that have happened over the last few years.

With this in mind, why do companies still view IT as a cost center?  Is it because companies still don't really understand technology? Or...is it because the IT group hasn't done enough to make the case for no longer being a cost center? Or is it because it is easier to remain a cost center and fly 'under the radar'?

For most organizations and CIO's, I'd argue its that middle option I provided above. Most CIO's have done a poor job of 'selling' the value of their organization.  Either they don't know how to sell the value of their team or don't want to. Regardless of the answer, many CIO's are comfortable remaining a cost center.

That comfort is why many <a title=""The Sidelined CIO"" href=""http://ericbrown.com/sidelined-cio.htm"" target=""_blank"">CIO's are being sidelined</a> today. Those sidelined CIO's are complaining about the fact that they don't feel 'included' but most have put themselves on the sidelines by not driving change within their teams and within their organizations.

Mark ended his post with a very good comment. <a href=""http://www.switchscribe.com/why-we-value-it-incorrectly-innovation-vs-cost-center/"" target=""_blank"">He wrote</a>:
<blockquote><span style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Plant the seeds of innovation, hire the right people, accept some level of risk, don’t be afraid to make tough decisions in real time, and maximize the opportunity that is locked up in information technology. This doesn’t mean you do everything internally, and it doesn’t mean the opposite. What it means is that your teams learn to accept the notion that innovative thinking can come from anywhere; how you leverage it is what is really important.</span></blockquote>

9203,The Data Center of Tomorrow,"<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot_34.jpg""><img class=""alignleft wp-image-9206 size-medium"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot_34-300x160.jpg"" alt=""Data Center of Tomorrow"" width=""300"" height=""160"" /></a>The data center of tomorrow will look much differently than the data center of today. That particular sentence should not be that surprising to anyone who’s been in an organization that has internal data centers.

Most organizations have been working on data center transformation projects over the last few years. With these transformation projects, companies have been looking for ways to implement automation, virtualization, cloud integration and other efficient technologies to allow the data center to become much more than a just a place to store servers for an organization.

I’ve worked with a number of organizations who have kicked off data center transformation projects. These companies have started their projects with an initial plan to replace aging or under-utilized servers and systems but quickly pivoted from a ‘equipment replacement’ project to a complete rethinking of how they use their data centers.

Many of these companies realized during their initial planning phases that they could do so much more with their data center. They realized the data center could be much more than a cost center if they took the time to think about how best to transform their data centers. By using virtualization, automation, converged systems and other technologies, data centers could be transformed into so much more than they thought it could be just a few short years ago.

With the introduction of virtualization, automation, Software Defined Data Center (SDCC) technologies, converged platforms, cloud systems and other technology platforms and systems, companies can now build out a data center that can deliver any type of functionality and feature the company needs today, tomorrow or in the future.

This new type of data center goes by many names but I tend to use the term “<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/?s=agile+data+center"">agile data center</a>” to describe the new data center. The agile data center <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/right-services-right-way.htm"">helps organizations deliver the right services in the right way (to the right people)</a> but it also helps these companies contain costs while growing the capabilities available within the data center.

The organization’s that understand the value of the agile data center have changed the thinking about what the data center is and how the organization will use it. This ‘different’ thinking has caused the data center to undergo drastic changes. Some organizations are moving the majority of their data center functionality to the cloud while others are building hybrid systems with public and private cloud systems. Still others are completely gutting their data centers and replacing the systems with converged infrastructure to build container based systems within their data centers.

A few years ago if you asked IT professionals how to build a data center, they’d most likely give fairly straightforward answers based on the ‘old tried and true’ methods. Today if you ask that same question to those same IT professionals, you’ll most likely get as many different answers as you possibly could.

The data center of tomorrow is going to look so much different than the data center of today. Gone will be the bureaucratic processes and legacy systems. The data center will be a combination of internal and external systems that combine to create an agile, efficient and effective technology delivery platform.

The data center of tomorrow will be an agile data center.

9210,Disaster Recovery and the Agile Data Center,"<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/cloud-disaster-recovery.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-9211"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/cloud-disaster-recovery-300x225.jpg"" alt=""cloud-disaster-recovery"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /></a>If there was one time that a data center and an IT group absolutely need to be agile, it would be the time immediately after a disaster strikes.

Disaster recovery planning is a challenge for every organization. The challenge doesn’t come from understanding the ‘what’ of disaster recovery; everyone knows what <em>should</em> be done to appropriately protect for disasters. The challenge for most organizations comes with the ‘how’ and the ‘when’ in disaster recovery planning.

Understanding (and implementing) the “how” of disaster recovery involves a great deal of thought and preparation to ensure that data is backed up to the appropriate location at the appropriate time to ensure disaster recovery processes work without a hitch when the time comes. Also, backup systems must be implemented and prepped to be able to take on the burden of systems that are lost during a disaster.

In addition to preparing data and systems for disaster, the “how” of recovering from any disaster must be considered. How will data and systems be restored? How will staff access systems and data in order to recover from any disaster? While these questions might be considered basic disaster recovery questions, they are the important ones to answer before disaster strikes.

A challenge that arises along with the “how” of disaster recovery is the “when” of disaster recovery. When should data be backed up? When should data be replicated across multiple locations to ensure redundancy? When should restoration procedures be tested? When is your disaster recovery plan ‘good enough?’

Adding to the many challenges of disaster recovery, IT professionals have a very keen focus on getting their systems and data (and organization) as quickly as possible. In the times of disaster, the IT group needs to be able to bring their business back online as quickly as possible. To do this, the key driving factor for IT and disaster recovery must be agility.

The cloud has brought a level playing field to the IT professionals for many aspects of business but it especially shines in the realm of disaster recovery. With the flip of a switch, organizations can have fully redundant systems and backups for all aspects of the business. Additionally, when disaster strikes an organization’s data center, it is fairly easy to flip another switch and recover their systems, data and functionality from these cloud-based systems.

While the cloud isn’t the answer to every disaster recovery problem, it is an answer to those organizations looking to enable or expand agility within their data center, IT group and disaster recovery plans.

An effective disaster recovery plan requires an <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/agile-business-needs-agile-group.htm"">agile data center requires and an agile IT group</a>.   How effective (and agile) are your disaster recovery plans?

9213,A Primary Goal of an Agile Data Center - Portability,"<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pennwell.web_.400.320.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-9215"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pennwell.web_.400.320-300x240.jpg"" alt=""Data Center Portability"" width=""300"" height=""240"" /></a>If you ask one hundred people (or companies) what it means to have an <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/agile-data-center.htm"">agile data center</a>, you’ll most likely get a large number of diverse answers. While you’ll most likely hear different answers from different people, I think many of those answers would fall into line with what I wrote in “<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/right-services-right-way.htm"">The Right Services in the Right Way</a>.” In that article, I wrote that having an agile data center means that organizations are capable of “delivering the right services at the right time in the right way to the right user.”

The above definition is fairly broad but I think it is a good one. It encapsulates the entire range of things that an agile data center can do for an organization. <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/building-agile-data-center.htm"">Building and managing an agile data center</a> isn’t easy nor is it ‘cheap’ in the short-term, but building a data center that provides agility should provide long term benefits including the potential for lower operating costs over the long term.

When I talk to people about the agile data center, I use the concept of ‘portability’ as an example of what it means to own and manage an agile data center. When I talk about portability, I’m talking about the ability to move an application around to ensure it is in the ‘right’ location to deliver the best results to the business. Whether that location is the cloud or the data center shouldn’t matter to the organization.

Trevor Clark, partner at Tech Research Asia (TRA), <a href=""http://agiledatacentre.cio.com.au/2015/01/27/new-data-centre-goal-workload-portability-strategy/"">claims that approximately 78%</a> of companies surveyed want or expect portability of their data center applications and systems. While that survey was conducted mainly in Australia, I’d suspect similar results regardless of where the respondents are located.

Portability of applications (and data) is only achievable if a data center is built and managed with an agile mindset. If your data center is slow moving and legacy-driven your ability to move data and applications to the ‘right’ location will be negatively affected. That doesn’t mean that you can’t push for portability within a non-agile data center but it does mean that it isn’t going to be as easy and cost effective to accomplish as it would be for an agile data center.

Having the ability to move applications, data and even workloads from the data center to the cloud (or to other data centers within your organization) is vital to ensuring that your systems and networks are optimized and running as efficiently as possible.

There are many challenges that need to be overcome in order to make portability a reality. Applications need to be rewritten, data portability processes and issues need to be addressed and vendors need to be chosen and contracts negotiated. Even with these challenges, the act of portability should be pretty straightforward for those companies who have built an <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/building-agile-group.htm"">agile data center and an agile IT group</a>.

Portability isn’t the only goal of an agile data center but it should be one of the primary ones. How well is your organization positioned for data and application portability?

9221,What is the Cloud...Really?,"<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/iStock_000007651615XSmall.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-4151"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/iStock_000007651615XSmall.jpg"" alt=""question mark"" width=""200"" height=""200"" /></a>I read a lot of blogs and articles talking about the cloud. Many of these articles try to go really deep into the technology stack found within the cloud while others try to keep the discussions at a very high level.

While reading some of these articles, I realized that there is rarely a basic question asked of readers. I never see anyone take a step back and address one of the basic questions that I always hear from many clients.

I often get asked to explain the cloud. People ask me to tell them what the cloud really is. For some of us that may seem a bit strange since the cloud has been around for so long but there are still plenty of people that don’t really understand the cloud.

Take a second to think about the cloud. Have you ever stopped to ask yourself what ‘the cloud’ really is? If you have asked that question of yourself (or your team or organization), what type of answer did you come up with? Is the cloud a technology or is the cloud a platform?

Does it really matter whether you can define the cloud? To be honest, I don’t think it matters whether you or your organization can define the cloud and it doesn’t matter what the technical definition of ‘cloud’ really is.

All you (and your company) need to understand about the cloud is what it can do for your business. Sure, you need to understand the basic concept of the cloud, but you shouldn’t need to define the cloud in technical terms to be able to think strategically (and tactically) about what the cloud can do for your business.

The types of questions you and your organization should be focused are strategically and operationally focused. You should be asked questions like how can your organization build new revenue streams using the cloud’? Can you deliver your services more efficiently and effectively via the cloud? Could you build a more efficient and optimized data center operation using aspects of public, private or hybrid cloud based systems?

I’d assume that the answer to these types of questions are going is a resounding ‘yes’ or at least most of you should be able to answer with a resounding ‘probably.’   The cloud can do a great deal for an organization without the majority of the people within the business really understanding the intricacies of cloud technology.

Back to the original question. What is the cloud...really?

The cloud is a platform (or technology or system) that an organization can use to deliver services to their clients (both internal and external) in a way that allows services to be delivered in the right way at the right time.   It really is as simple as that.

There’s no need to go into any more depth into the cloud or the technologies involved. The technical intricacies can be worked out with the IT group’s technically adept professionals and the technical teams from the vendor (or vendors) that your organization may choose for your cloud deployment.

To those people that ask me to explain the cloud and define the cloud, I normally stay very far away from technical descriptions of the cloud and try to define the cloud in terms of what it can do for a business.

How do you usually define the cloud to your colleagues, organization or clients?

9224,Everything As A Service,"<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bigstock-Page-Cloud-32989445.jpg""><img class=""alignleft"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bigstock-Page-Cloud-32989445-300x225.jpg"" alt=""Everything-as-a-service"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /></a>It seems like every article you read about technology today includes a service delivered in an ‘-As-A-Service’ approach. We have an abundance of Software-As-A-Service (SaaS), Platform-As-A-Service (PaaS), Communications-As-A-Service (CaaS), Infrastructure-As-A-Service (IaaS) and many other X-aaS systems/platforms. In fact, XaaS is being used to denote the ‘Everything-As-A-Service’ mentality.

The ‘Everything-As-A-Service’ approach is one that makes a great deal of sense. If an organization can decide they need a new platform or a new application they don’t have to undergo a long, drawn-out technology selection project and subsequent implementation project to get the right technology within their data center.

Using XaaS, a company can identify the technology, platform or application they need or want and then simply sign a contract or sign up for service. There’s no need to look at data center sizing, efficiency, utilization rates or power requirements to ensure a new platform can be implemented. There’s no need to spend months trying to integrate a new platform or application with your existing infrastructure (although integrating XaaS can be just as difficult as non-XaaS is).

Regardless of where you might stand on the XaaS model, there’s no denying that the approach provides organizations with the ability to deliver services and systems quickly and efficiently without a large capital outlay to purchase, install and integrate new systems and hardware.

Additionally, the XaaS model allows organizations to build agility into everything they do. From start to finish, <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/building-agile-group.htm"">everything the IT group does can be agile focused</a> and every project undertaken within the IT group and within the data center can have agility baked into the core of the project.

Another valuable reason to adopt the XaaS approach is that it lets IT group build itself into an “as-a-service” offering. IT as a service is the next generation of IT service to organizations. IT as a service is the model for <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/right-services-right-way.htm"">delivering the right services to the right people at the right time in the right way</a>.

IT as a service is agility personified. With the ‘as-a-service’ approach, the IT group can quickly deliver any application, system, service or platform to the organization in a way that should allow lower costs, better management and more efficient operations when compared to the legacy approach that was focused on data center centric systems and platforms.

I’ve written a bit about the <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/?s=agile+data+center"">agile data center</a> over the last few months. To <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/building-agile-data-center.htm"">build the agile data</a> center, the IT group needs to become agile themselves. To become more agile, the IT group can adopt the XaaS mentality and models to build and manage agility throughout the organization and within the data center.

Is your organization seriously considering the XaaS approach to systems and platforms?

9237,Does IT Agility Equate to Business Survival?,"<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1M.png""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-9238"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1M-300x138.png"" alt=""IT Agility Key to Survival?"" width=""300"" height=""138"" /></a>I’ve been writing about <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/?s=agile+data+center"">agility within the data center and IT group</a> recently. I truly believe the future of IT (and the business) requires that those of us in IT rethink how and what we deliver to our organizations.

While reading a white paper titled “<a href=""http://www.symantec.com/agile-data-center/"">Agile IT Empowers Business Success</a>”, I ran across an intriguing sentence:  “<i>If the business can’t adapt, it may not survive</i>.“ I’d actually change that to say that, in most instances, if a business can’t adapt, it <b><i>will not</i></b> survive.

To enable a business to adapt, a business must take a look at a all aspects of their business. They need to look at systems, technology, processes, people and the culture of the business. While the entire business needs to be analyzed and transformed, one of the focal points for any organization should be their IT group.

In order to drive this adaptability, organization’s require both an <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/agile-business-needs-agile-group.htm"">agile business and an agile IT group</a>, which is something I wrote a bit about last week.  In that previous post, I argue that the IT group must transform itself into an efficient and agile group in order to help the business become more agile.

I’ll go a step further and say that the IT group must be one of the leaders of the transformative change throughout the business.  Adapting to the fast-changing business environment today requires a great deal of technological agility so it makes sense to have the IT group be at the forefront of this change.

This type of transformation isn’t an easy undertaking. It requires an organization take a look at all aspects of their business including processes, technology, systems, people and culture.  While I’ll leave the ‘people’ and ‘culture’ topics for others to work through, the processes, technology and systems fall squarely in the wheelhouse of the IT group.

One of the areas that can be reviewed fairly easily for agility (or lack thereof) is the data center.  The data center is the backbone of the modern organization and, as such, plays a large role in determining how agile and adaptable the business can be. If that data center cannot provide the agility needed for today’s fast-paced environment, the business will suffer.

Some organizations are hesitant to undertake a transformative project like this due to the costs. While there can be large initial costs to replace legacy systems or build out new capabilities, these costs can usually be recouped in a short time from lower operational and management costs throughout the following years.

In order for companies to survive and thrive in the future, their data centers and their IT groups will need to be operating from an agile mindset. No longer can the CIO and IT group be comfortable in their old legacy systems and thinking - they must develop and maintain an agile approach to the business to allow that business to survive.

9241,Complexity - The Killer of Agility?,"<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/complexity.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-9243"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/complexity-300x225.jpg"" alt=""complexity"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /></a>I’ve said a few times that the <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/the-data-center-of-tomorrow.htm"">data center of today isn’t the data center of yesterday nor is it the data center of tomorrow</a>. In fact, in “The Data Center of Tomorrow” I wrote that the: “data center will be a combination of internal and external systems that combine to create an agile, efficient and effective technology delivery platform.”

While I believe that will be the case in the near future (if it isn’t already the case today), the data center of tomorrow has the potential to add complexity to the organization’s IT systems and platforms. This complexity may just be a simple replacement of other types of complexity or it may be adding complexity to the data center. Either way, complexity has the potential to be an agility killer if it isn’t managed or planned for correctly.

Complexity has always existed within the data center. From the first day of data center existence, IT professionals have had to manage complexity but in recent years there’s been quite a bit of growth in complex systems within the data center. With companies increasing their use of virtualization within their data centers, connecting data centers with the cloud and implementing new platforms and systems every year, the level of complexity continues to increase.

Without proper thinking and planning, this complexity can have a negative effect on agility within the data center. There are a few things that organizations can do to attempt to manage complexity within the data center while keeping agility at the forefront of the IT group and the data center. A few ideas for managing complexity are:
<ul>
	<li>Get visibility into the platforms throughout the organization to ensure that the IT group understands what platforms the business has</li>
	<li>Get visibility beyond the platforms to allow IT to understand the business processes that are driving platform changes</li>
	<li>Ensure open communication channels between all groups within the business to ensure when a new platform is needed or wanted, IT is informed and involved in the decision making process</li>
	<li>Have a proper business technology strategy that drives all technology projects.</li>
	<li>Build a technology council and invite members from all areas of the business to allow different opinions and insights into the technology strategy of the organization</li>
</ul>
As you can see from these ideas may not seem that great at first, they are a starting point for understanding the technological systems and platforms within the company. By understanding your platforms, you can understand the complexity that exists (or might exist in the future) and help keep agility alive.

Last week I read a post titled ""<a title=""Why most digital transformations will fail (and how to make sure yours doesn’t)"" href=""http://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/04/01/why-most-digital-transformations-will-fail-and-how-to-make-sure-yours-doesnt-2/"" target=""_blank"">Why most digital transformation projects will fail (and how to make sure yours doesn't)</a>"" written by Martin Gill, VP and Principal Analyst at Forrester Research.   Martin provides a very good overview of why he believes most digital transformations will fail (and I agree wholeheartedly with everything he writes).

The interesting thing about Martin's article is that he doesn't focus on the 'digital' aspect of the transformation. This is significant because transformation isn't really anything new. Companies have had to transform their business models or they've died.  Digital transformation is nothing special olr new...its just another change that companies have to undergo to remain competitive.

They key for ensuring a successful transformation of any kind is proper change management. Whether that transformation is a digital transformation or the 'next' transformation to come along, if you can't implement a well managed and properly planned change management project, your transformation project <em><strong>will</strong></em> fail.

At the end of his article, Martin gives his advice for ensuring your digital transformation project succeeds. He writes:
<blockquote>The way organizations have been planning and managing large-scale change is no longer fit for purpose.

We need a new approach. An iterative, customer-centric, and agile approach. One in which your digital strategy is engaging, easily consumable by all your key stakeholders, compelling, and, above all, responsive to the inevitable change we all face.</blockquote>
Notice that he leads off by stating that the key priority for ensuring success is a quality change management approach.  He doesn't talk about getting buy-in for 'digital' or some other topic...he talks about the importance of change management.

If you want to ensure your digital transformation project (or any other transformation project) succeeds, make sure you have a good idea in how to enact change within your organization. Without proper change management, any transformation you undertake is doomed to failure.",20150406,http://ericbrown.com/digital-transformation.htm,Innovation|Leadership|Management|Project Management,Change Management|transformation

G. Lafley titled ""<a title=""Playing to Win: How Strategy Really WOrks"" href=""&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/142218739X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=142218739X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=edbholdings-20&amp;linkId=CZODEXR5DH3E7ULI"" target=""_blank"">Playing to Win: How Strategy Really Works</a>.""

I've read the book and enjoyed it. I also enjoyed the particular passage that the author at Farnam Street highlighted in their post regarding the strategy 'traps'.  I won't copy/paste it here (<a href=""http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2015/04/six-strategy-traps/"" target=""_blank"">jump over and read it verbatim</a>) but I did want to highlight the 'traps' and talk a bit about them.
<h4>The ""Do it All Strategy"", ""Something for Everyone Strategy"" and the ""Waterloo Strategy""</h4>
These three 'traps' are very similar in my mind. Many companies (and people) think that if they broaden their focus and try to make their offerings as broad as possible, they'll bring more clients through the sales funnel and make more revenue. The problem with this approach is that if you aren't able to focus (and you aren't letting your teams focus), you'll rarely be the leader in anything. Additionally, you'll end up disappointing many of your clients because they'll receive a product or service offering that is sub-par.
<h4>The ""Don Quixote Strategy""</h4>
This is a dangerous strategy for any organization. It involves choosing the biggest and 'best' competitor and trying to knock them out of first place by competing head to head.  While this strategy may appeal to the ego's of many people, it is generally a terrible strategy for most companies.  Where it does make sense is if you have a game-changing technology or service offering...but how many of those come along every year?
<h4>The ""Program of the Month Strategy""</h4>
This is one that I'm sure everyone in the IT world has seen at one point in their career.  This is the strategy trap that many CIO's (and CMO's?) fall into while chasing the latest and greatest technology and/or platform. This type strategy never works because you never give your team a chance to actually make the last one a viable strategy. This trap does nothing but keep people busy doing semi-important work but never really focused on the long-term work that needs to happen to make a strategy really work.
<h4>The ""Dreams that Never Come True Strategy""</h4>
This trap is one of the most damaging ones to any organization. Companies can fall into this trap by always talking about a strategy and/or strategic plan but never actually putting the plan into action. Sure, they may think they are putting it into action but in most instances, they really never do.  I've seen this one time and time again in companies...and those companies always fail because they can never marry the strategy with the execution necessary to make it happen.
<h4>Beware the Strategy Trap(s)</h4>
These traps are very good ones that I've seen many people / companies fall victim to a number of times. There's no perfect strategy nor a is there a 'recipe' for a <em>good</em> strategy since each company's objectives and goals are different.

What strategy traps can you think of or have you seen in practice during your career?

If you haven't stumbled across The Enterprisers Project in the past, make sure to add it to your daily routine (RSS feeds, twitter, etc etc) as there is always some great content over there.

In ""<a title=""The CIO balancing act: agility, innovation, cost savings"" href=""https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2015/4/cio-balancing-act-agility-innovation-cost-savings"" target=""_blank"">The CIO balancing act: agility, innovation, cost savings</a>"", the author writes that the CIO maintain ""a delicate balancing act... between institutional (or corporate) agility, innovation, and cost savings. The CIO has to 'get' all three and maintain the appropriate balance.""

There is no argument that the CIO must be able to balance agility, cost savings and innovation. The challenge for today's CIO is maintaining this particular balance while moving much faster than many IT groups have ever had to move.  Most CIO's have had to balance similar priorities in the past but the idea of 'agility' was much different in previous years than it is today. Today, a business can't wait six months for a new server to be provisioned and made ready...that server is needed tomorrow.

That's why this particular balancing act is so important. Without agility, the innovative thinking, technology and systems that come out of the IT group might not do a company much good. Without delivering that innovation in a cost effective manner  - and delivering it with agility - the <a title=""The Sidelined CIO"" href=""http://ericbrown.com/sidelined-cio.htm"">CIO and IT group may find themselves pushed to the sidelines</a>.

One thing to note about the term 'agility' - we aren't always talking about speed here. Of course speed is important but agility also covers the ability to get things done.  While a company may be able to move fast, if their processes get in the way of that getting things done then all you are doing is moving fast to sit still while you wait for your processes to catch up with everything.

Take the provisioning of a server for example. It may take you only an hour to set up a server but if the processes needed to get that server ordered, installed and assigned to a project is so laborious that it chews up days, what good is having a provisioning time of an hour doing for that business?

Maintaining the balancing act as a CIO requires the ability to look at every aspect of your team and its processes to ensure bureaucracy doesn't get in the way of the priorities of the business.  Part of being a good leader and manager is understanding what the organization needs from you and your team and then making sure that those needs are met by your team.  Those needs might change tomorrow, next week or next month but as long as the CIO and their leadership team are in sync with each other and with the organization, the ability to maintain the delicate balance should remain.

9276,Making Theory Meet Practice,"<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Theory-Practice.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-9279"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Theory-Practice-300x199.jpg"" alt=""Theory-Practice"" width=""300"" height=""199"" /></a>This won't surprise many people (at least I hope it doesn't)...there is a huge difference between ""theory"" and ""practice"".

I'm an academic AND and practitioner. I have a Doctorate in Information Systems and have worked in aspects of IT / IS for almost 20 years now.  Theory is great at preparing people for doing things in the real world, but many times theory is just that...theory.

For example,  back in 2006, I earned the Project Management Institute's (PMI) Project Management Professional (PMP) certification. Prior to earning the certification, I had been managing projects for a number of years and was absolutely floored by the PMP study material and the 'theory' behind managing projects.  Sure, much of this theory is useful in some manner but much of it isn't practicable in many projects I worked on over the years.  I didn't renew my PMP certification when it expired because I didn't see the value in having those particular letters after my name. Also, don't get me started on companies that will only consider hiring Project Manager's with the PMP certification.  The PMP cert is a great example of 'theory vs practice'....just because you know the theory behind project management doesn't mean you can actually manage a project.

Another example can be found from my background.  I earned a <a href=""http://www.ece.okstate.edu/"" target=""_blank"">Master of Science in Electrical Engineering (MSEE) from Oklahoma State University</a> with a specialization in Wireless Telecommunications.   While working on my degree, I learned a lot of theory about wireless telecom and how to design systems.  I also learned a lot of other stuff related to Control Systems, Electrical Engineering, Neural Networks, Stochastics, Signal Processing and other  interesting (and difficult) stuff. I learned a lot of theory about how things work. I learned how to calculate things and design things...in theory.

When I got out in the real-world, I realized the theory was useful but not ideal. I didn't have any real knowledge about how to actually DO anything useful. At the time, I couldn't tell you how to add a new tower into a CDMA network or do PN planning for that tower/network. I couldn't tell you which antenna was best for a scenario. Sure, I knew the difference between an omni antenna and a directional antenna but the real-world use cases of antenna types was unknown to me.

Another example can be found with <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/category/doctorate/"" target=""_blank"">my doctorate work</a>. When I was looking for a topic for my dissertation I was told by many people to just 'pick something because you'll never revisit the work'. That was terrible advice for me...if I was going to spend time working on something, I wanted to get some value from it.   So...I chose to look at combining my interest in the financial markets with my interest in social media and sentiment analysis. This led to my dissertation titled ""<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/using-twitter-sentiment-market-decisions.htm"" target=""_blank"">Analysis of Twitter Messages for Sentiment and Insight for use in Stock Market Decision Making</a>.""

While my dissertation is very academic, I made sure to spend time on real-world application of the theory and developed <a title=""Trade The Sentiment -Twitter Sentiment Analysis and the Markets"" href=""http://tradethesentiment.com/"" target=""_blank"">Trade The Sentiment</a>. I wanted to make sure that theory met practice.

Making sure theory meets practice is a difficult thing to do for some but easy for others. I think there's probably some study out there that shows that some people are more prone to theoretical pursuits versus hands-on pursuits (and vice versa). That said, to be able to get things 'just right', <em><strong>you need to find a way to link up theory and practice</strong></em>.

We always read about those companies and people who are 'great' at what they do. There are tons of books on the subject of how to become 'great' (e.g., <a title=""Good To Great - Affiliate Link"" href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0066620996/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0066620996&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=edbholdings-20&amp;linkId=HJBPOWUO3LM6TOXY"" target=""_blank"">Good to Great</a>, etc) and many of these books tell you to 'do X and you'll be great'. It's never as simple as following a recipe but I can say that the companies and people that I know that are really good at what they do are able to make theory and practice mesh well together.

For example, one of the best project managers I know is a PMP and has been managing projects and programs for many years. She knows PMI's ""body of knowledge"" and project management better than anyone I know (except for maybe <a href=""http://herdingcats.typepad.com/my_weblog/"" target=""_blank"">Glen Alleman</a>) but she also knows how to apply that theory to each project. She knows what things to skip and what things to focus on while managing projects and she knows that each project is different and requires different management styles.   Her projects are generally on-time and on/under-budget and she rarely throws PMP 'theory' around while successfully managing these projects.

Merging theory and practice can be difficult and often takes considerable experience to be able to do successfully.   What tips do you have to make theory meet practice?

Many times the term 'big data' can cause fear in non-tech and/or non-data people. The term sounds so vague and so 'big' and can cause people to steer away from big data.  This is unfortunate because the size of the data doesn't really matter - only the data, the context of the data and what you are able to do with the data is what matters.  This book helps to remove some of the fear that might come along with big data.

This book takes the user through an introduction of big data and how marketers (and others) can use many different types of data to better understand their customer base, their marketing efforts and their business. The author does a very good job describing how the reader could use existing data combined with other data gathered from social media and user-generated content.

The great thing about this book is that you don't need to be a marketer to get value from it. Just about anyone, including social scientists, financial analysts and others can find some value within this book.  I strongly suggest this book for anyone looking to learn more about big data.

In the article, the author writes:
<blockquote>The great art of life is in balancing the short term and the long term, so that one can have enjoyment with integrity - pleasure with purpose. But in most areas of life, we pay strict attention to the immediate consequences of things. We look at the immediate results of a social or economic policy and call it a victory (or a complete failure).</blockquote>
The solution to  'short term' thinking, according to the author, is to ask ""...and then what?"".  By asking this simple question, we can force ourselves to look past the immediate and into the longer term. The author writes:
<blockquote>The problem is that so few of us take the effort to do this very simple thing. It’s understandable, we get caught up in the moment, and we don’t particularly enjoy thinking in minute detail each and every moment of our lives. But in the coming era, it will become increasingly important for us to ask these kinds of things, as our interconnectedness makes ideas and new technologies spread faster than ever before.</blockquote>
This very simple step of asking ""...and then what?"" can make a huge difference to any individual's or organization's planning process. By thinking about the step after the step, you'll be able to open up plans to include much more than just the things needed to get the current project complete.

A perfect example of the lack of asking ""...and then what?"" can be found with most instances of the phenomenon known as <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/shadow-it-aka-doing-what-it-wontcant.htm"">Shadow IT</a>.  Shadow IT usually arises because the IT organization can't/won't give a person/group a technology/system that they think they need. This group then goes out and finds something to fill their immediate need without thinking ahead. What will happen when the data in that new system needs to be integrated with other company systems, needs to be backed up or you need to move it to another cloud service provider? These are all very simple scenarios that can be covered if you simply ask ""...and then what?""

Are you and your organization asking yourselves ""...and then what?"" during your planning?",20150506,http://ericbrown.com/and-then-what.htm,Leadership|The New CIO,Leadership|planning|thinking

9318,The most critical skill?,"<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/large-icon.png""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-9321"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/large-icon-300x169.png"" alt=""large-icon"" width=""300"" height=""169"" /></a>I'm an avid reader. I tend to read a few books at a time (I read one depending on my 'mood' at the time).

The other day, I was scrolling through the various sections in Amazon's Kindle Unlimited program and somehow ended up in the 'self-help' section.   Now, I'm not a fan of self-help books because they tend to try to tell people that they can follow a 'recipe' and then they'll be 'all better.'  Life doesn't work this way...but self-help guru's sure want readers to think that way.

While scrolling through the self-help section, I saw a ton of 'learn to be wealthy...', 'love yourself...', 'follow these rules to be X..' (substitute anything for X) and other 'standard' self-help books that, in my opinion, really won't help many people.

In the middle of all these books, I found one that actually <em><strong>would</strong></em> help just about anyone that read it.   I don't remember the actual title of the book but it was something like 'critical thinking - the only skill you'll ever need.'  If you (or anyone) only reads one self-help book, it should be one on how to think critically and apply the skill to your life.

I've written about <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/critical-thinking-vs-creative-thinking.htm"">critical thinking</a> before. I believe its a skill that we all need to continually practice and apply to our lives <em><strong>and</strong></em> its a skill that is lacking these days.  Thinking critically can help anyone in any situation.

Need to get out of debt?  Sit down and think critically about why you are in debt and then come up with a plan to get out of it. Want to make more money?  Sit down and think critically about why you want to make more money and then come up with a plan to do it.  Maybe you won't become a millionaire but you could get a second job to pay off that debt or send your kids to college.

Maybe you need to reorganize the entire IT group.  Do you go out and buy a book about how to organize an IT group or do you sit down and think critically (and impartially) about how your team needs to be organized to deliver the services that your organization needs?  I know some CIO's do the former but most successful CIO's take the latter approach.

Critical thinking is extremely important for a person and for an organization.  If you feel the need to buy a self-help book any time soon, try finding one on the topic of 'critical thinking.'

In that article, Jeffrey argues that before a company can innovate its products/services, it must innovate its processes if it hopes to build a sustainable edge via innovation over its competition.

When I read Jeffrey's post, I found myself nodding at everything he wrote. While the need to focus on innovation in your product / service line is a real one, many organizations completely miss the need to look at process change to support these innovations.

Jeffrey provides a good example in his article on why process change is needed. He writes:
<blockquote>..most product development processes do a poor job allocating resources and establishing priorities, and are bogged down with poorly defined projects and inadequate staffing levels.  It's exceptionally rare for products to exit the process on time and on budget.</blockquote>
Anyone that has been involved in an type of project management or product management role will immediately agree with the above statement. Heck..anyone in IT will immediately agree with this statement.   There's never enough people or resources to do everything, yet it feels like everyone is asked to do everything...and do it now.

In addition to the resource issue, there are many organizations with outdated and ill-informed processes for getting things done.

I recall an IT group in the not too distant past (we are talking 2008-2009 time-frame) that required a change request to be manually filled out with pen/paper and then handed to a secretary. This secretary would then take the change request form around to get signatures from the necessary people and then FAX the change request to the change management team.  Mind you...this team was located in the same building, yet they required a faxed copy of the change request.

The above example might seem like an outlier (and maybe it is) but I've run across many outliers like this in my career. Companies are so focused on the new and innovative that they forget to look internally at their own processes.

In order to truly innovate your product and/or service line, you need to look at your own processes first. It may not be as 'sexy' as building that new product, but its just as important (or maybe even more important) than that new product.

Back to the example I provided earlier. That company could not have delivered an innovative product or service and sustained that product/service.. In fact, they tried a few different things and even started an 'innovation group' to focus on innovation but the majority of ideas that came from this group where stonewalled by the arcane processes found within the company. It wasn't just the IT group that had out of date processes...every part of the organization needed to have some process re-engineering done. Ultimately, this organization had to step back and rethink many of their internal and back-end processes before they could focus on innovation.

Processes are the lifeblood of an organization. If you don't step back and take a look at your processes, your innovative ideas might just suffer.",20150526,http://ericbrown.com/innovation-needs-process-change.htm,Featured|Innovation|Leadership,Innovation|Leadership|Process

9335,Normalcy Bias and You,"<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Stormy_Weather.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-9339"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Stormy_Weather-300x210.jpg"" alt=""Normalcy Bias"" width=""300"" height=""210"" /></a>If you aren't familiar with the term ""normalcy bias"", here's a <a href=""http://www.yourdictionary.com/normalcy-bias"" target=""_blank"">quick definition</a>:
<blockquote>Normalcy bias is...the phenomenon of disbelieving one's situation when faced with grave and imminent danger and/or catastrophe. As in overfocusing on the actual phenomenon instead of taking evasive action, a state of paralysis.</blockquote>
Another way to think about normalcy bias is the often used term in project management circles of 'analysis paralysis.' A <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias"" target=""_blank"">much simpler way to think about normalcy bias</a> is that it is an assumption that nothing bad will happen in the future because nothing bad has happened in the past.

I hope everyone reading this can see how dangerous normalcy bias can be, especially for people or organizations going through difficult times.  People are smart and can generally see that things aren't working out for them or their company...but very few people take action to make a change.

I can provide a real-world example from my past to illustrate this point.
<h3>An Example</h3>
While in grad school for my <a href=""http://www.ece.okstate.edu/content/ms-degree-program"" target=""_blank"">MSEE</a>, I worked in the telecom industry and did some contracting work at a major telecom player in the mid to late 1990's. This company was a leader in the telecom space and was growing by leaps and bounds but just about everyone I spoke with at the company was worried about the future of the business.  They didn't know how the business could continue to grow at the pace they had been growing at and were always amazed that growth continued at a record pace.   I was a dumb kid with little life experience and couldn't quite understand how the business was growing so rapidly but I just figured there were people way smarter than me making decisions and leading this company so I just shrugged my shoulders and went about my work.

Things were apparently great for this particular company throughout the 1990's. They were setting records for revenue and growing rapidly. Everyone I spoke with at the company was concerned that the company was going to implode 'soon' because they just didn't understand how the growth could continue.  There was a real fear of a major catastrophe 'soon' but nobody seemed to be doing anything about it.  Everyone was focused on an implosion because they didn't feel like things were going that great but nobody seemed to be taking any steps to 'fix' the problems.  I remember speaking with some folks back then about the issues and can clearly remember someone saying ""well...nothing bad has happened yet so I doubt it will.""

Everyone that I spoke with was guilty of falling into the normalcy bias trap. I fell into that trap as well.  The normalcy bias trap is an easy one to fall into...its 'easier' to expect nothing bad to happen even while being presented with bad news.  People (and entire companies) can (and do) tend to ignore the bad news and expect things to 'work out.'

By the way...that company I used in the above example WorldCom. They filed the<a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2002/07/19/news/worldcom_bankruptcy/"" target=""_blank""> largest bankruptcy ever filed (at the time) in 2002</a>.  There was plenty of reasons for people to be worried about their operations and business model but instead of trying to do something about it, people ignored it.  That said, there are many times that things <em><strong>can't</strong> </em>be done because people at the top don't want things to change...but that's a different issue.
<h3>Normalcy Bias and You</h3>
The above example isn't an ideal one because there are plenty of extenuating circumstances that could have kept people from doing anything about the impending 'disaster'.  As it turns out, there were plenty of things wrong at WorldCom but there were people at the top of the company that were actively working to hide any wrongdoing and any issues. That said, there were plenty of people suffering from normalcy bias because they assumed things would be fine in the future because they had always been fine even with all of the issues that existed.

Normalcy bias is a very dangerous thing.  By assuming things will always be fine because they have always been fine, you are putting blinders on to issues and not preparing yourself or your organization for change that is most likely coming.

Normalcy bias can be your downfall and the downfall of your business.  Don't let yourself fall into the trap of focusing on the outcome to the extent that you paralyze yourself from doing anything. Also, don't make the assumption that nothing is going to happen because it hasn't happened yet...there are too many examples of failure of families, companies and societies to allow yourself to assume nothing bad will ever happen to you or your business.

To overcome normalcy bias, identify the issues that might happen and be prepared if they do. Don't go overboard of course but have a plan of action to address the issues you see, minimize the risk that those issues might cause and then have a plan to deal with the fallout from if the issue(s) are ever realized.

Don't let normalcy bias destroy your life, career or company.  Identify the risks in your life/business, mimimize or remove those risks and then create a plan for how you will deal with those risks if they become reality.",20150603,http://ericbrown.com/normalcy-bias-and-you.htm,Strategy|Thinking|Uncategorized,normalcy bias

More feedback from clients can help you improve your service.  More money can help you build better products and teams. More data can help you make better decisions.  More resolution can make your photos better.

More is always better isn't it?

Well. No. More isn't always better.

<a href=""http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2015/06/high-resolution-is-not-the-same-as-accurate.html"" target=""_blank"">Seth Godin recently said</a> that ""Too much resolution stops giving you information and becomes merely noise, which actually gets in the way of the accuracy you seek.""

This is very true. Anyone that's ever worked with data will tell you that more data just means more work. Sure, you may find a great nugget in that additional data, but that extra data doesn't always equate to more knowledge but it <strong>always</strong> equates to more work.

To Seth Godin's point, more 'resolution' isn't always the answer either. I can go buy a $50,000 camera with the highest resolution possible and still make terrible photos. Just because I have the resolution available to me doesn't mean I have the lenses available to take advantage of that resolution nor does it mean I have the talent to utilize the high resolution.

More isn't always better.  Adding more data to your already large data set isn't going to find the answer for you. <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/whats-difference-business-intelligence-big-data.htm"" target=""_blank"">It might help you find more questions to ask</a>, but it doesn't guarantee that an answer will be found.

Rather than go spend $50K on the 'best' camera, spend $500 on an OK camera and learn the skills and methods  needed to make the most of what you have. When you've mastered your 'art', then move up to something more expensive with more functions.

Rather than focus on gathering <em><strong>more</strong></em> data, you need to be focused on <em><strong>using the data you have in the most optimal way possible</strong></em>. Make sure you have the tools and skills in place to analyze / use what you have before you go and add 'more' to the mix.",20150610,http://ericbrown.com/more-isnt-always-better.htm,Data|Featured|The New CIO|Thinking,information|Knowledge

9358,"Big Data, Big Analytics and You","<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/analytics-600.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-9360"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/analytics-600-300x150.jpg"" alt=""big-analytics"" width=""300"" height=""150"" /></a>Big data has been a popular topic over the last few years.  Many organizations have been studying big data systems and processes as well as the science behind capturing, storing, analyzing and using large amounts of data within their businesses.

Many organizations that I’ve worked with over the years have done a very thorough job of understanding the technology requirements of big data. They have adopted technologies and systems to allow them to capture and store enormous amounts of data from many different parts of their organization. Additionally, many of these companies have begun to capture data from outside their organization to understand how their use of social media and other marketing channels affects their business and customer base.

While these companies have the technology skills to capture, store and process data at a large scale, many of the organizations I’ve spoken with are at a bit of a loss for what to do with the data.  I’ve had more than a few CIO’s and CMO’s tell me that they have the infrastructure in place to handle big data but they aren’t sure they have the skills needed to take advantage of all of the data they have. These organizations have the basic skills to do simple analysis but most are lacking in the skills (and the people) to be able to truly dive into their data to find the questions and answers that lay within that data.

When people talk about big data today, there is very little talk about big analytics. Many people assume that data analytics is part of the discussion that is being held, but that assumption is often wrong.  Everyone knows analytics are important, but often everyone thinks ‘they’ are thinking about the analytics aspect of big data. IT professionals tend to focus on the technical aspects of big data while marketing tends to focus on what they can do with all the data they have but few focus on the step needed to get from the ‘collection/storage’ phase to the ‘usage’ phase.

This is unfortunate because in order to use all that data being collected, it must be converted from ‘data’ to ‘knowledge.’ To make that conversion happen, you need to have quality analytics tools and people with the right skills to use those tools.  Without the ability to analyze your data, you’ve really just done nothing more than waste money to store enormous amounts of data.

Big data is obviously important to most organizations. There’s plenty of data out there and even more data being generated every day.  But big analytics is just as important. Without the ability to analyze the data you have at the speed and scale it is being generated, your organization will never really be able to fully take advantage of big data.

Is your company taking the time to think and plan for big analytics?

In the article, the author, <a href=""http://www.business2community.com/author/larisa-bedgood"">Larisa Bedgood</a>, does a very good job of addressing the question of whether big data is important for organizations to focus on.  The author rites that:
<blockquote>The moral of the story? It’s about the data, or rather the <em>insights derived from the data</em>. It’s not enough to simply collect the data. Your data must tell a story. Stories of who your customers are, what your competitors are doing, what offers will be most appealing to prospects, which cross-sell and up-sell opportunities you should offer, and so on.</blockquote>
So true.

Big data is indeed worth it as long as you approach the collection, storage, analysis and use of data in the right way. Your data must tell a story but you must be willing to have that story write itself rather than forcing the story along the lines you want it to go.

If you are 'doing' big data the right way, <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/whats-difference-business-intelligence-big-data.htm"" target=""_blank"">you'll often find more questions than answers</a>, but that's what makes big data 'worth it'. With big data, you aren't just going through the motions...you have to truly put the effort in to find the real value within your data.

Is bit data worth it? Absolutely...but only if you put the time and effort into the analysis of that data. Big data isn't easy, but it is worth it.",20150701,http://ericbrown.com/is-big-data-worth-it.htm,Big Data|Featured|The New CIO,analytics|Big Data

“Big data is obviously important to most organizations. There’s plenty of data out there and even more data being generated every day. But big analytics is just as important. Without the ability to analyze the data you have at the speed and scale it is being generated, your organization will never really be able to fully take advantage of big data.”

I wanted to follow up that post with another that talks a bit more about the importance of analytics and converting data into actionable insight.

If you ask business executives if they’d prefer more data or more insight into their business, most would (and should) say that they want and need more insight into their businesses. Some people might argue that in order to get more insight, you need more data but in my experiences this is far from true.

More isn’t always better. More data doesn’t deliver more insight. Businesses do not need more data, they need to be able to<em> use data better</em>. Once an organization figures out how to analyze data more effectively to gain the insights they need, only then will more data make a difference.

Data itself is interesting but useless until you do something to find and understand the ‘signals’ contained within. Until you convert your data into information you have nothing of value. Until this conversion happens, you’ve done nothing but waste money on collecting and storing a whole lot of nothing.

In order to turn this ‘nothing’ into something, companies must find ways to turn find the signal within the enormous amounts of data. This signal will then lead to gaining information, knowledge and, ultimately, wisdom. This is where ‘big analytics’ comes into play because in order to truly find value in big data, you must analyze that data at scale. Sure, you can use excel or some other simple approach to try to dig through your data but excel won’t cut it for the large amounts of data that most organizations need to analyze.

Companies need to analyze at scale to find the insights that their executives need and want. This requires the right analytics tools and systems, the right people with the right skills and a culture that allows people to dig into whatever data they feel is necessary to find answers (and new questions).

Neither big data nor big analytics is <em>the</em> answer to today’s business problems but they are the start to finding many answers that a business needs to find as well as finding some questions that organizations didn’t know they had. It won’t be easy and it can be expensive, but if you are truly looking for insights into your business, there’s no better way to find those insights than by combining a good big data strategy with a good big analytics strategy.

Big data and big analytics can provide big insights for any organization willing to put the time and effort into building a big analytics practice.

9397,The Dichotomy of Data Access and Data Privacy,"<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/yin-yang.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-9399"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/yin-yang-300x225.jpg"" alt=""yin-yang"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /></a>In order to use data within your business, you must first collect that data. Seems simple enough right?  You capture some data, store it somewhere and the use that data at a later time in your analysis.

What about data privacy concerns? Where are you collecting your data? How are you protecting that data?  Are you collecting/using social network data or other user-generated data from public sources?   If you are using data from ‘users’, do they know their data is being collected, stored and used for something other than the system it was generated in?

These types of questions are the ones that every organization and data scientist should constantly be asking, especially if a single byte of captured and/or analyzed data is generated by a consumer or user of your systems.

In addition to the data that you might capture within your organization (and perhaps from social media, blogs and other user-generated content), there will be data available from data brokers. It may not be next week or next year, but you can bet that all the data that are captured via wearables and other Internet of Things devices will be made available for a price.

Over on Business Value Exchange, Helen Beckett, in a post titled “<a href=""http://businessvalueexchange.com/blog/2015/07/10/watch-out-the-personal-data-market-is-coming-us/"">Watch Out! The Personal Data Market is Coming</a>”, writes:
<blockquote>Citizens and consumers, who generate thousands of bytes of data every day – switching on devices or utilities, making purchases, boarding transport or just walking down the street in CCTV cities – can celebrate. The data they collectively generate is an asset that is being mined to create value and making companies and even industries rich on the back of it. Now the personal data exchange is coming.</blockquote>
Companies will jump at the chance to buy data from these brokers and exchanges and begin using that data in their analysis. Just think about how powerful it would be for an insurance company to have access to your health data via Apple Health or Fitbit or data from a device in your car that reports on speed, location, distance driven, etc.

From a data science and an organizational perspective, having access to data like this is an enormous advantage for any company looking to better understand their clients.  If you can gather data on individual users daily activities, it makes it much easier to market to those users as well as customize your products/services to those users.

From an individual perspective, it is a little frightening to know that every aspect of my driving or my fitness routines (or lack thereof) could find its way into the hands of my insurance company. Likewise, it is disconcerting to know that said data could also make its way into the hands of companies who want to market their services or products to me based on where I’ve driven or how far (or how little) I’ve walked in the last few weeks.

As data scientists and organizations, we want to be able to access and analyze as much data as possible and we want data that is as granular as possible.  With personal data available today (or available in the near future), we have very granular data.

As individuals, we are (or should be) concerned with how companies are using our own data.  We at least want to know how that data might be used and when it is being used.

This is the dichotomy we face today. We want to use as much data as possible but we also worry about data privacy of our own data.  The challenge for any organization or data scientist is to find the right balance between using the right data with the right granularity with necessary privacy issues that consumers need and want.

How is your organization balancing data privacy and data access?

Their idea of analysis is looking at a few finance reports to see how the business is doing.

Now, if this particular client was a small business, I'd have no problem with this approach....but they aren't. They are a multi-million dollar business with multiple departments spread across multiple states. They really should no better - and their CEO said as much to me during our first conversation.

I've been working with this client to set up processes to collect, analyze and use data throughout their business. When I started the project, I spoke to the CEO about the need to not only work on data collection and analytics but also the data 'culture' within the business.  The agreement was that I would work on the data collection/analysis aspects and the CEO would drive the cultural change needed.  Not ideal but that's how these projects go sometimes.

According to a conversation I had with the CEO a few weeks ago, the project has been a huge success. The company is now talking about data in ways they never did. Their CEO is constantly looking for additional data to help make better decisions. Data is being incorporated into all aspects of the strategic planning process to try to develop stronger plans for the future.

When I spoke to the CEO last week, I wasn't a bit surprised to hear him say the following:
<blockquote>Everyone has all the data they will ever need, but nobody is actually using the data!</blockquote>
Apparently, the majority of people within the business love all the data and 'reports' but they aren't actually using that data to make any real changes to their operations. They are viewing the reports and, by all accounts, love to see 'what is happening' but they aren't viewing the data or reporting with a critical eye to making improvements to their business.

This is the 'data culture' issue that needs addressing within most organizations.  You can collect and analyze all the data you want but if you don't use that data for something more than taking up storage space and processing time, you are wasting money and time.

9414,Today's Data Challenge is Yesterday's Data Challenge,"<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/meeting-challenge-icd-10.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-9415"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/meeting-challenge-icd-10-300x199.jpg"" alt=""Challenges"" width=""300"" height=""199"" /></a>If you spend any amount of time reading or talking about big data, you'll often find that one of the challenges facing an organizations use of big data today is the same as problem that these organizations faced just a few years ago: <em>using the data to actually do something.</em>

Before the popularity of big data, most large organizations were focused on building their ‘knowledge warehouse’ to store data. Using business intelligence tools, these companies would then build out reports for various departments to run. These reports were generally very static (e.g., month-end financial reporting) and rarely did they provide any way for users to dig deeper into the data behind the reports.

The challenge in the 'old’ days was to get people to look at these reports with a critical eye to using that data to improve the business. Many organizations did a good job at this but the vast majority of companies I’ve worked with and for did not. Most people within these organizations would see these reports, make sure there wasn’t any surprises contained within the reports, consolidate the reports into other reports and then move on. Very rarely did anyone dig any deeper into the data and if they did, they’d assign the additional analysis to an analyst and ask them to find out something didn’t look right.

What I find interesting is that I still see this same approach even within companies that claim to be ‘data driven’.  These companies have exponentially more data than they had just a few years ago, yet they still treat this data (and the analysis of that data) in the same way.  They spent a great deal of money on platforms to collect and analyze data yet the data analysis process remains the same.

The exact same challenge that faced organizations in years past exists today. They have data, analytics and reporting capabilities but rarely dive into the data for anything more than basic static reports. Additionally, the output of the analysis is generally reviewed and then put on a shelf (or deleted) without any real thought into what that analysis means or could mean to their business.

Today’s data challenge is the same challenge that has plague organizations for years. If you don’t use data to truly understand your business and make changes based on the analysis you do, you are wasting precious time and money.  Data (and the analysis of that data) is useless worthless until you actually use it.

I started working with this company to help them open up access to all their data repositories to allow people within the company to access and analyze the data without having to go to a data analyst to ask for a report or data set.   Everything that I've suggested this organization needs is being stonewalled by this particular individual with responses like ""that isn't secure,"" ""they can't see that data"" and ""that isn't their data.""

After many meetings without any real movement, I decided it was time to bring in the CIO into the discussion to help with either breaking down the walls this person was putting up or to tell me that those walls were staying put regardless of my suggestions.

The CIO, VP and I sat down and began discussing the issues and concerns that the VP had regarding my suggestions.  After we walked through all my suggestions and all the reasons the VP declared that they couldn't be implemented, the CIO asked a few questions for clarification. After a few minutes of back and forth, the CIO declared to the VP that ""we don't own this data, the business owns this data...find a way to make this happen.""

I thought that was an excellent response from the CIO - ""we don't own this data"" is a far cry from most IT professional's feelings about dat. Many view data as their 'property' because they are the ones tasked with storing and protecting it.   That's not a bad thing...but it has made many within IT feel like they have to say 'no' more than they say 'yes' to requests.

Through much negotiation and teeth gnashing, the VP and I were able to work through all of my suggestions and develop a plan to implement the necessary systems to reach their objective.  Included in this plan are proper data management and data governance systems and processes along with the right type of analytics engine to allow just about anyone within the organization  to take a look at data that interests them.

The key point of this is to highlight the fact that IT professionals don't ""own"" the data. We don't get to say 'yes' or 'no' to who gets access and what can be done with that data. We are just the keepers of the data and need to think about systems and processes that allow <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/data-is-only-as-good-as-you-make-it.htm"">the organization to use that data</a> in whatever way makes the most sense for the business at any given time.",20150806,http://ericbrown.com/data-ownership-within-an-organization.htm,Big Data|The New CIO,data governance|data management

9427,The Benefits of Open Data Within an Organization,"<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Open-data.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-9428"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Open-data-300x220.jpg"" alt=""Open Data"" width=""300"" height=""220"" /></a>A recent article by Christian McMahon titled “<a href=""http://businessvalueexchange.com/blog/2015/07/31/open-data-how-far-do-we-go/"">Open Data - How Far Do We Go?</a>” got me thinking about the idea of ‘open data.’  Christian’s article discusses the idea of open data in general where entire data sets are freely available to anyone that wants to access and use that data for whatever reason.

Christian’s idea of open data is a great one and it can be re-defined as an idea that can be used within organizations. The idea of open data can be thought of as making all (or at least most) of an organization’s data available for access and analysis by anyone that needs or wants it.

Open data within an organization isn’t really that far-fetched. With the right data governance and data management systems and processes, a company can make all of their data-sets open to anyone within their organization while keeping security, privacy and access rights in mind.

Making data more open can bring quite a lot of value to an organization. By opening up data to more people, a business can become much ‘smarter’ by way of having more eyes and ‘brains’ focused on various data sets.  Just imagine what you’ll be able to accomplish with hundreds of people looking at data throughout the day rather than just a few data analysts?   What type of insight might be found when people of different backgrounds and experiences have the ability to dig into an organization’s data?

Having more people digging through your data also means less work for the already over-worked data analysts.  The need to continually create new reports and start analytical projects for relatively minor requests will go away if the people asking for those reports and projects have access to the data that they need to review.  Of course, a company will still need professional analysts and data scientists to do much of the heavy lifting with big data but taking an open data approach can add value by freeing up their time.

One additional benefit to the open data approach is that it can democratize the organization by making information and knowledge much more available which can lead to many things including innovation and growth for the business.  You never really know where a new idea will come from so why not make it easy for anyone within the business to analysis data and find new knowledge?

Open data allows organizations to take the fullest advantage of the world of big data.  With the size of data growing inside most organizations today, it just makes sense to open up that data to as many people as possible to give your business the best opportunity for finding those little ‘nuggets’ of knowledge that lead to real innovation.

Is your company approaching your data with an ‘open data’ mindset?",20150818,http://ericbrown.com/the-benefits-of-open-data-within-an-organization.htm,Big Data|The New CIO,

9444,Best practices aren't enough,"<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/51FmzfJx-YL.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-9445"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/51FmzfJx-YL-202x300.jpg"" alt=""Trading Psychology 2.0: From Best Practices to Best Processes"" width=""202"" height=""300"" /></a>I'm currently reading Brett Steenbarger's ""<a href=""http://amzn.to/1Mqv4xQ"" target=""_blank"">Trading Psychology 2.0: From Best Practices to Best Processes</a>."" I'm a fan of Dr. Steenbarger's work and bought his new book as soon as it was released.

While this book is targeted at traders and investors, there's a great deal of knowledge that can be gleaned from it that can be applied to many other aspects of your personal life as well as business.

For example, the premise of the book is that the four main 'habits' a trader should focus on to improve their trading are ""adaptability, creativity, productivity, and self-management.""   Those four habits are ideal of any individual and any company to focus on as well.   Just like a trader, a business can have the best strategy in the world but if they can't execute on that strategy and adapt to changing markets in a creative way, the strategy is (or will become) worthless.

I ran across this nugget in one of the first chapters and thought it worth sharing:
<blockquote>...what makes traders good are best practices—sound methods for deploying capital and managing risk. <em><strong>What makes traders great are best processes: detailed routines that turn best practices into consistent habits</strong></em>. Adaptability, creativity, productivity, and self-management: These aren't just things that the best traders have. They are what best traders do—routinely.</blockquote>
<em><strong>Emphasis mine.</strong></em>

Interesting concept isn't it?  Best practices aren't enough....to be consistent and remain in business as a trader, consultant, person or company, you need best practices <em>and</em> best processes.  But the key to long-term success in anything is how you build, change and manage your best practices and best processes.

A best practice today isn't going to be a best practice next year.  The same is true for processes. Something that works today may not necessarily work next year.   You need both best practices and best processes but you also need to have the wisdom to know when those need to change to adapt to the changing marketplace.

This is where the four key habits come into play.  If you can adapt your strategy you can survive.  If you can think of new ways to approach your market and client base, you can survive.  If you can be both creative and adaptable while doing the right things and managing yourself and/or your business, you'll not only survive but you should thrive.

Best practices aren't enough. You've got to add best processes into the mix.  Additionally, you (or your business) need to have the smarts and creativity to know when its time to change those processes and practices to better align yourself and your strategy with existing or future market conditions.

Back to the book...while it is targeted at trading, there are a lot of very valuable insights that can be applied to all aspects of your life...I highly recommend it.",20151014,http://ericbrown.com/best-practices-arent-enough.htm,Featured|Strategy|Thinking,planning|Strategic thinking

9458,"To have a great analytics culture, you need a great communications culture","<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Employee-communication.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-9459"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Employee-communication-300x300.jpg"" alt=""Employee-communication"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>When you read about big data and/or data analytics projects and systems, it is rare that you also read bout communicating the outcome of those projects. Without the ability to communicate the results of any analysis to the broader business, most big data / analytics projects are doomed to mediocrity...or even failure.

The quantitative mind is a great one. It is one that I'm very familiar with and one that I wholeheartedly support.  The ability to take a data set, analyze that data and create new information and knowledge from that data is an extremely important skill for people and organizations to have.

Just as important is the skill to be able to convert the outcome of any quantitative analysis into something that is easily digestible by people throughout an organization.

Take, for example, the world of academia.  There are many really smart people performing research within universities and research facilities. These people conduct research and then publish the outcomes of that research in academic journals to share their new-found knowledge with others.

Have you ever picked up an academic journal/article? These articles are generally well-written and delivered in formal academic styles but they aren't exactly 'easy reading'.   They are meant to be used for academic reporting within academic circles. They are also used within industry but most practitioners that read these journals and articles are usually people with similar education and experience as those folks who are writing / publishing these articles.

What happens when a finance manager picks up the Journal of Finance paper titled ""<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304405X77900150"" target=""_blank"">Determinants of Corporate Borrowing</a>?"" Will they easily understand what the paper is trying to communicate?  Let's take a look at a portion of the abstract of the paper:
<blockquote>Many corporate assets, particularly growth opportunities, can be viewed as call options. The value of such ‘real options’ depends on discretionary future investment by the firm. Issuing risky debt reduces the present market value of a firm holding real options by inducing a suboptimal investment strategy or by forcing the firm and its creditors to bear the costs of avoiding the suboptimal strategy. The paper predicts that corporate borrowing is inversely related to the proportion of market value accounted for by real options. It also rationalizes other aspects of corporate borrowing behavior, for example the practice of matching maturities of assets and debt liabilities.</blockquote>
I would argue that anyone - given enough time - could understand what that paragraph is trying to communicate, but in the fast-paced world of business, does anyone really have time to sit down and study this paper?  I doubt it.  Most will call up a consultant and ask to help better understand the optimal approach to corporate debt.  What is that consultant going to do?  She will take her experience as a consultant (and in finance/banking), study the business, literature and best practices and then make a recommendation to the business on what they should do. If the consultant is any good, these recommendations will be provided in an easy to understand document that can be implemented effectively within the organization.

The same approach needs to be taken with data analytics.  We can't just throw a spreadsheet or chart over the wall at the business and expect them to understand what the data is telling them or what they should with that data. I see a lot of this these days though. A company will implement a new big data project, perform some analysis of the data and then provide the output of the analysis in pretty charts and tables but very rarely are there deep, meaningful discussions and analysis about what that data is really telling the business and/or what the business should do based on the data analysis.

Now, you may say that good data scientists / analysts already do this...and you'd be right. But, not everyone is a great analyst nor is it a skill set that most organization's are hiring for these days. When I talk to clients about big data, they talk about the need to get the best hardware, software and analytical skills...but they rarely talk about the need to find great communicators.

Companies regularly spend millions of dollars on the 'hard' costs for big data and data analytics. They've even begun spending a good deal of money on the 'soft' costs to get their people the best training available so they can be the best data analysts available but it is rare that they spend much money on communications training.

The funny thing about this particular topic is that <a href=""http://www.burtchworks.com/2014/09/23/flash-survey-quants-communication-skills/"" target=""_blank"">most data scientists consider themselves to be good communicators</a>.   In my experience, the really good ones are...but the majority of the 'new' data scientists struggle with this aspect of their job.

If you want to be a great data scientist, become a great communicator and storyteller. As a data scientist, if you can't communicate in a way that is informative and useful to the business, the work you do in the 'quant' world isn't that valuable to the company.  The same can be said to the business in general - if you want a great data analytics culture, build a great communications culture. You can't have one without the other.",20151022,http://ericbrown.com/to-have-a-great-analytics-culture-you-need-a-great-communications-culture.htm,Big Data|Communication|Featured|Strategy|Thinking,Big Data|communications|data analysis

Big data sure makes it easier to solve big problems, but you can just as easily use big data and data analytics to solve 'smaller' issues.

In fact, if your organization is just getting started in the world of big data, it makes sense to find a few smaller problems to try to solve.  These small problems allow you to tweak your systems and processes to make sure you are gathering, storing and analyzing data correctly. These small problems also let you build up the appropriate skills within your teams to ensure when the big problems come along, your teams are ready to handle them.

Wouldn't you feel better about your big data initiatives if you could 'prove' that the systems, processes and people were working effectively and giving output that can be believed? Most people would...and that's why most organizations should start with these small projects.  There's nothing worse than getting 6 months (or a year) down the big data road and realize your data has been collected and stored in a way that makes it difficult to believe whether that data is correct and 'clean'.

As important as making sure your systems, processes and people are working effectively is, it is just as important to make sure your organization is ready to accept the outcomes of any big data analysis.  There's nothing worse than spending time and money and realizing that your organization (or certain people within your organization) aren't willing or able to accept the outcome of work performed analyzing the company's data.

Starting small with big data lets you and your organization get comfortable with the entire process of collecting, storing, analyzing and reporting.  Big data doesn't have to require big projects, big budgets or big teams...especially when starting out.",20151103,http://ericbrown.com/start-small-with-big-data.htm,Big Data,Big Data|planning|Strategy

One of the highlights is extremely important. It relates to the importance of finding actionable insights from big data and sharing those insights in a way that the organization can use.  The quote is:
<blockquote>I think you need three ingredients. You need data, you need the right ways to combine the data and extract features from that data, and then the third ingredient is <em><strong>the ability to analyze the data and bring together the analysis results in a way that provides these insights and these measurable actions</strong></em>. ... [They] need to be able to know what actions [they] need to execute in response to these analytics....</blockquote>
<em><strong>Emphasis mine.</strong></em>

So many times when talking about big data, we get ourselves wrapped up in the technologies, processes and systems that we forget to think about the real reason we are even working with data in the first place.  Data is near worthless until it is analyzed.  Sure, you can put some 'value' on data but unless you turn that data into information (and then into knowledge) your doing nothing more than being a data hoarder.

So...to my data hoarding friends I say: Don't focus on the data, focus on what the data tells you.  I don't care if you have 1 GB of data or 1 PB of data, if you can't turn that data into information and then knowledge, your data initiatives aren't going to succeed.  Additionally, if you can't <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/to-have-a-great-analytics-culture-you-need-a-great-communications-culture.htm"" target=""_blank"">communicate the insights gained from your analysis</a>, your missing out on the real value in data analysis.",20151105,http://ericbrown.com/dont-focus-on-the-data-focus-on-what-the-data-tells-you.htm,Big Data|Strategy,Big Data|insights|planning|Strategy

Along with the report, they've released an infographic that I thought worth sharing but before the infographic, let me share a few of the highlights and offer some opinion on the results.

A few highlights from the report:
<ul>
	<li>4% of respondents are able to extract full value from the data they have</li>
	<li>36% of respondents lack the tools and/or skills necessary to extract value from their data</li>
	<li>66% of respondents obtain little to no benefit from their data</li>
	<li>25% of respondents do not see any value in the data they have and don't believe it would add value in any form of decision-making processes.</li>
</ul>
I was pointed to the PWC / Iron Mountain report via a CIO article titled ""<a href=""http://www.cio.com/article/3003538/big-data/study-reveals-that-most-companies-are-failing-at-big-data.html"" target=""_blank"">Study reveals that most companies are failing at big data</a>"". In that article, the author uses the data from this report to claim that companies are failing at big data. I don't think that's what the data is saying at all...I think the survey responses show that companies are trying to figure out how to 'do' big data but very few have really got it under control.  That lines up well with my experience working with clients as does the survey results in the report.

This survey (and others) tells me that we are still <a href=""http://www.gartner.com/technology/research/methodologies/hype-cycle.jsp"" target=""_blank"">very early in the lifecycle (or hype cycle) </a>of big data.  Lots of people are talking about it and lost of people/companies have extreme expectations about what they can do with big data, but few have really figured out how to make big data work for them. According to <a href=""http://www.gartner.com/technology/research/methodologies/hype-cycle.jsp"" target=""_blank"">Gartner's Hype Cycle</a>, I think we are still in the up-cycle between 'technology trigger' and 'peak of inflated expectations' for most organizations.

Are companies failing at big data? Sure...but I think that's just because most companies are still very early in the learning cycle for big data. Give it some time and we'll see these survey results change.

Before I give you the passage, let me put the sentence into context.  The CIO article is discussing a recent IDC report titled '<a href=""https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=IDC_P33689"" target=""_blank"">IDC FutureScape: Worldside CIO Agenda 2016 Predictions</a>.' This report provides some predictions on what the CIO and IT  will be focused on for the coming year(s).

The passage that caught my eye was this one:
<blockquote>According to IDC, the biggest issues in IT leadership will center on business needs, capabilities and availability related to digital transformation. The data shows that <em><strong>two-thirds of CEOs plan to focus on digital transformation strategies for 2016</strong></em> and that CIOs will be major players in leading every department through this shift. In terms of capabilities, <em><strong>only 25 percent of CIOs report feeling confident in how they are driving new digital revenue streams.</strong></em></blockquote>
<em><strong>Emphasis mine</strong></em>.

When I read that paragraph, I was a bit perplexed as to how two-thirds of CEO's will be focused on digital transformation and the CIO will a 'major player' in leading these initiatives while at the same time only one-quarter of CIO's felt confident in how they and their teams are driving new digital initiatives and revenue streams.

Now - before anyone skewers me, I do realize that digital transformation is about much more than finding new revenue streams. Digital transformation covers all aspects of the business from finding new revenue streams to reducing costs throughout the business via technology.  CIO's know how to do the latter...but as we see from the survey, not many of them are confident they can do the former.

If CEO's are going to be focused on digital transformation in 2016 and CIO's are going to be one of the leaders of those initiatives, one would think that those CIO's would be much more confident in their capabilities (and abilities) to drive revenue. Right?

Sure, CIO's can help to drive digital transformation without 'knowing' how they are doing with digital revenue streams, but if I were a CEO, I'd want to know my CIO had a real handle on all things digital, including how digital is driving revenue.  Alternatively, if I were a CIO and I knew the CEO was focusing on digital transformation, I'd be doing everything in my power to make sure I (and my team) were fully up to speed on what we were doing, planning to do and could potentially do in the coming year.

Based on the responses in this survey, I worry that the the CEO and CIO aren't quite on the same page when it comes to digital transformation going into 2016.",20151201,http://ericbrown.com/digital-transformation-are-ceos-and-cios-aligned.htm,Strategy|The New CIO,CEO|CIO|digital transformation|Strategy

I'll leave you to go read Michael's write-up on the subject...he does a good job pointing out the highlights.   I did want to point out one of the results from the report that discusses innovation and the CIO within organizations.  From the report:
<blockquote>...there is a sizeable gap of 32 percent between CIOs and non-CIOs regarding whether the role has a strong impact on technological innovation and creativity. Nearly one-third of non-CIOs feel their CIO has little or no impact, but only 6 percent of the CIOs feel they have little impact, and none feel they have no impact. The low percentages of those reporting little or no impact across both groups show a solid footprint on the part of the CIO.</blockquote>
This particular passage has the following chart to accompany it:

Still, that's a majority of people that believe the CIO/CTO have some impact on innovation and creativity when it comes to using technology.</span>

9493,Perfect Takes Work,"Every so often I run across a story that leaves me in awe. A story out of Scotland about a photography who has spent years trying to make the 'perfect' picture is one of those stories.

In ""<a href=""http://www.wired.com/2016/01/alan-mcfadyen-kingfisher-dive/"" target=""_blank"">A Perfect Photo of a Kingfisher, 720K Pictures in the Making</a>"", the story of <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/46443141@N07/"" target=""_blank"">Alan McFadyen's</a> attempt to capture the 'perfect' photo of a kingfisher diving a mirror-like water surface is described. From the article:
<blockquote>Thus began an obsessive quest for the perfect shot, a quest McFadyen estimates took some 4,200 hours and 720,000 exposures. He tried many angles and compositions before landing on the idea of a mirror image.</blockquote>
4200 hours and 720,000 images.  Can you imagine? Sure...its much easier to take that many photos with a digital camera these days and with the speed of modern professional gear, you can rattle off 10 images a second but still...4200 hours (175 days if worked straight through) is a long time looking for that 'perfect' image <a href=""http://petapixel.com/2015/11/25/this-shot-of-a-diving-kingfisher-was-6-years-and-720k-photos-in-the-making/"" target=""_blank"">over the course of 6 years</a>.

<h4>Perfect takes Work</h4>
I've been known to say 'perfect destroys good' and 'done is better than perfect', but in this case, I have to agree that 'perfect' <em><strong>is</strong></em> perfect.  Sometimes, it <em><strong>is</strong></em> worth the effort for perfect.

The takeaway from this (other than an absolutely stunning image) is that perfect takes work. You don't show up to your first day on the job or project and do things perfectly. You don't pick up a camera and take the perfect image on your first attempt.

Perfect takes work. Are you willing to do the work?

9516,Stop Using Pre-Scripted Questions in an Interview,"<img class=""alignleft wp-image-8277 size-medium"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Stop_sign_page-300x300.png"" alt=""Stop_sign_page"" width=""300"" height=""300"" />Over my career, I've hired over 50 direct reports and been involved in the hiring process for over 150 other people.  For the most part, all of these hires ended up being good people and great employees. Sure, there were a couple bad hires in there but I'd like to think my track record is pretty good mostly because I approached each interview as a conversation rather than a list of questions.

Many of these hires were technical people that filled roles as engineers, data scientists, trainers, technical support, consulting and sales roles.  I've seen (and hired) the gamut of roles throughout my career so I think I'm in a position to say the following:
<blockquote>Please...PLEASE...stop using pre-scripted question forms.</blockquote>
Please stop walking into an interview with a list of questions that are you are going to ask one after another. Please stop going down a list of 'required' questions that you got from HR or from the internet.

For example, I was hiring for a position way back in my earliest days of my career. During the phone interview, the hiring manager spent 30 minutes going line by line down a page full of pre-scripted questions (e.g., Tell me a bout a time you were creative, Give me an example of how you've been a leader, etc etc).  The interview was a very halting, non-interactive process that was painful.   It was also a process that made me realize I had no interest in every working for that company and that manager.  <em>Side note: My response to the ""tell me about a time you were creative..."" was ""...last time I interviewed someone, I came up with my own questions.""</em>

If you only ask a set of pre-scripted questions, you are doing yourself and your interviewee a huge disservice.  You aren't allowing them to be themselves <strong><em>and</em></strong> you aren't allowing your own personality to come out during the interviewing process.  I realize there might some companies that require a certain set of questions to be asked during the hiring process. I'm OK with that as long as the hiring manager takes their time to ask their own questions and have a conversation with the person they are interviewing. That conversation needs to be a real conversation that touches on all aspects of the role you are interviewing for.

For example, take a look at this <a href=""http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blog/show?id=6448529%3ABlogPost%3A371610"" target=""_blank"">list of questions for data scientists</a>.  There's some great questions on there about the technical aspects of 'doing' data science but I'd lose my mind if I were sitting through an interview with those questions being asked of me.  Many of those questions are what google and stackexchange is for.  Sure, you want to hire a technically competent data scientist but sitting down with a list of questions like that isn't the only way (or even the best way) to do it.

Rather than use that list as-is, a good hiring manager would use that list as a baseline to try to build a 'road' to try to lead a candidate down.  Rather than ask questions like ""<em>What is latent semantic indexing? What is it used for? What are the specific limitations of the method?</em>"" why not get the candidate talking about their recent projects and try to lead them down a road that talks about the approaches the took, the analysis methods they used and the decisions they made in how they approached the data?

Pre-scripted interview questions are great to give you ideas on what topics you want to cover, but make the interview your own. Don't use the list as a crutch...have a conversation with the person you are interviewing...don't just lob questions at them.",20160128,http://ericbrown.com/stop-using-pre-scripted-questions-interview.htm,Management|People,Hiring

One of the key findings from that study is that here are three main roadblocks to big data success. <a href=""http://fortune.com/2016/02/05/why-big-data-isnt-paying-off-for-companies-yet/"" target=""_blank"">They are</a>:
<ul>
	<li>Being in too big of a hurry</li>
	<li>Trying to start too 'big'</li>
	<li>Not incorporating corporate culture into big data initiatives</li>
</ul>
In my work with clients on big data, that third roadblock is the one that tends to cause the most problems.  Sure, many companies want to through big data at all their problems (or is it throw all their problems at big data?) but it doesn't take long for them to realize they need to start small and go slow to make sure they know what they're doing within the big data world.

Roadblock #3 is the one that gets most companies into trouble, especially those that are very bureaucratic.  These bureaucratic companies tend to attract people that like to hold onto information because it makes them feel more 'powerful' or in control.  If you implement big data systems and processes correctly, your organization should become much more information rich, which is something that bureaucrats don't really like.  Therefore, it is imperative to big data success that organizations remove the bureaucrats and bring in a more open, sharing culture.  Fisher and the AICPA agree:
<blockquote>Busting up the bureaucracy, so information can flow quickly to the right people, requires a kind of manager that the AICPA study refers to as “integrative thinkers.” The relatively few organizations that are making profitable use of big data have hired or cultivated executives Thomas describes as “collaborative leaders who can see horizontally across their whole organization and connect the dots.”</blockquote>

9567,The technology debate is usually the wrong debate,"<img class=""alignleft wp-image-9568 size-medium"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Debate-300x225.jpg"" alt=""Debate"" width=""300"" height=""225"" />Windows vs Mac vs Linux.  Android vs iPhone.  Nikon vs Canon vs Sony.

Spend any time online, with techie friends or with photographers and you'll run undoubtedly come across arguments about which tech is better. You'll have people calling others 'fan boys/girls' and in some areas you'll see some downright nasty comments about whichever tech someone doesn't agree with.  You'll see people commenting that Android (or iPhone) sucks, Linux (or Mac or Windows) is superior and Nikon (or Canon or Sony) is the only camera a 'real' photographer uses.

The problem with these types of debates is that they are generally not grounded in real-world experience. For example, the guy that adamantly argues that Nikon completely destroys Canon cameras in every area of competition has never shot anything other than a Nikon. His arguments are based on reading 'tech specs', blogs and forum posts about how much better Nikon is than Canon.  Sure,  there are valid 'technical' reasons for stating that one technology is better than another (e.g.,<a href=""http://www.dxomark.com/Cameras/Compare/Side-by-side/Nikon-D810-versus-Canon-EOS-5D-Mark-III___963_795"" target=""_blank""> the Nikon D810 DSLR has one of the highest DxOMark ratings ever at 97, versus the 81 given to the Canon 5D Mark III</a>), but technical data isn't the only way to measure technology.

In my experiences, how a person (or company) USES technology is more important than what technology they use. Take the Nikon vs Canon debate...fan-boys will throw the great results of the Nikon cameras into the faces of Canon users at every chance they get, but their argument becomes worthless when a photographer uses a camera that is about 8 years old to take a photo that wins the <a href=""http://petapixel.com/2016/02/19/here-are-the-cameras-that-won-world-press-photo-2016/"" target=""_blank"">World Press Photo of the Year for 2015</a>.  Debating the technical merits of a technology is meaningless if you aren't willing to step forward and actually use that technology (or any other technology) to deliver real-world results for yourself or your company.

The Android vs iPhone debate is another good example. You could spend days reading all the reviews, blogs and forum posts about how Android is better than iPhone (or vice versa). You could talk to endless friends and colleagues about which phone is 'best' but until you make the decision to buy one and start using it, you'll never know how it will work<em> for you</em>.  Honestly, 95% of users will find both the Android and iPhone to be comparable and never really need to know the difference in the two platforms/ecosystems...the phone will just work for them and they'll be perfectly happy.

The same is true for 95% of businesses that choose one platform over another. As long as you've done your due diligence and ensured the platform that you've chosen will meet your needs, you'll most likely be happy with whatever technology you choose. The technology debate is usually the wrong debate to have. The right debate to have is to focus on how you will use whatever technology you have (or might acquire) to deliver something of value to yourself, your family or your company.  You can have the best technology in the world and still deliver terrible results or you can have technology that is one, two or even three generates behind the 'modern' tech and deliver award winning results.",20160222,http://ericbrown.com/the-technology-debate-is-usually-the-wrong-debate.htm,Featured|Technology|Technology Strategy,Strategy|Technology

You can't try the spectacular without doing the simple first. Make the simple pass. Our guys are trying to make the spectacular plays when we just have to make the easy ones. If we don't get that cleaned up we're in big trouble.</blockquote>

I wanted to take the 'simple leads to spectacular' line and expand on it from the perspective of doing anything in life, but specifically talk about this approach to big data.

You can't just get into a plane and be a pilot; you need to learn the basics first. You can't just be a brain surgeon; you need to learn the basics first. The same is true for developers, data scientists, managers and just about every other profession. You can't just pick something up and be the best at that something on day one. Being the 'best' at anything takes effort as well as a bit of skill. Add a little talent, and you really have the opportunity to be really good at something.

I talk about this same type of thing with many clients when they start talking about big data. Many people want to dive into big data. They want to 'do all the things' without really making sure they understand the simplest of things. They want to throw terabytes of data at systems and data scientists without making sure their organization is ready to incorporate the output of big data initiatives.

Starting too big and being in a hurry in big data are two of the <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/the-three-roadblocks-to-big-data-success.htm"" target=""_blank"">biggest roadblocks to success in big data</a>. If an organization starts too big or gets in too much of a hurry, they may not get the simple things right to start with, which will make it more difficult to get the big things right in the future.

The simple leads to the spectacular.  If you can start small, do the simple things right in your big data initiatives, you have much more of a chance to get the big things right. <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/start-small-with-big-data.htm"" target=""_blank"">Start small</a> and you might just find your big data initiatives turning into something spectacular.",20160309,http://ericbrown.com/get-basics-first-go-big.htm,Big Data,simple

9591,Will marketing continue to grow their share of the technology budget?,"<img class=""alignleft wp-image-9594 size-medium"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/marketing-martech-operations-e1438547961450-300x300.jpg"" alt=""marketing technology budget"" width=""300"" height=""300"" />If you are involved with marketing and/or technology in any large organization, you most likely are hearing a lot about marketing technology (MarTech) and the 'explosion' of MarTech people, technology, projects....and budgets. There are some folks out there who claim that within a few years, <a href=""http://my.gartner.com/portal/server.pt%3Fopen%3D512%26objID%3D202%26mode%3D2%26PageID%3D5553%26ref%3Dwebinar-rss%26resId%3D1871515"" target=""_blank"">marketing will be spending more on IT than the CIO</a> but many IT professionals I speak with just have a hard time accepting that marketing will ever drive more spend on tech than IT does/will.

My response to these folks is simple: <strong><em>It is already here</em></strong>.

Let's take a second to think about some of the higher priority items for the IT group. According to the <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/295616740/State-of-the-CIO-2016"" target=""_blank"">2016 State of the CIO</a> report from IDG, the top 3 priority items for CIO's in the coming year are:
<ul>
	<li>Complete a major enterprise project</li>
	<li>Help reach a specific goal for corporate growth</li>
	<li>Upgrade IT security</li>
</ul>
Those first two items are pretty broad and specific to each organization, but they could easily relate to MarTech projects. For the last item on IT security upgrades, the report says that about 12% of the IT budget will be spent on upgrading IT security (which seems low to me, but I'm not as close to security as I am to other parts of IT).

Another nice little nugget of knowledge from the <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/295616740/State-of-the-CIO-2016"" target=""_blank"">2016 State of the CIO</a> report is the following:
<blockquote>57% of the total dollars invested in tech is now directly controlled by IT (and is expected to grow to 59% in the next 3 years).</blockquote>
One thing to notice with this particular stat - while the majority of budget is controlled by IT, there's no real detail in the report on where or how that money is spent other than to say that 33% of marketing's budget is currently set aside for technology.

All the numbers and data points mean very little without some context, which is what many IT professionals (and non-marketing people) lack.  The spend on MarTech five years ago was generally small. Marketing groups would spend money on content management systems, web analytics platforms and e-commerce systems but very few were investing money in large, enterprise-level systems. That has changed in most medium to large organizations. Today, marketing organizations are spending money are those enterprise systems because they now understand how important an integrated, enterprise platform can be for driving engagement and revenue.

Will marketing continue to grow their technology budget? I think so.  Will IT professionals continue to complain about that? Probably....but the majority will realize how important MarTech spend is to the future of the organization.",20160315,http://ericbrown.com/will-marketing-continue-grow-share-budget.htm,Information Technology|Technology Strategy|The New CIO,IT budget|IT security|Marketing Technology|martech

9611,Five things the CEO wants to know about Big Data,"<img class=""alignleft wp-image-9613 size-medium"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3b686_5NumberFiveInCircle-300x300.png"" alt=""Five things a CEO needs to know about big data"" width=""300"" height=""300"" />I spend a lot of time talking to companies about big data and data science. Many conversations are with people at the CxO level (CEO's, COO's, CFO's, etc etc) and usually revolve around basic discussions of big data and data analytics.   One of the things that has surprised me a little from these discussions is that these CxO level people have the same basic questions about big data.

Those of us who are consultants and practitioners within the big data space like to wax poetic about big data and data science like to think that 'this time is different' and that big data is really going to change things for the better for any company.   While that may be the case, there are still some very basic questions that need to be answered within every organization before any major investment is made. The questions that I hear most from CxO level people can be categorized into the following types of questions:
<ol>
	<li>What is it?</li>
	<li>Why do we care?</li>
	<li>How is this different than {insert name of previous approach here}?</li>
	<li>What is this going to cost?</li>
	<li>Who is going to manage this?</li>
</ol>
All valid questions and all questions that should be expected when any major initiatives are being discussed. Additionally, these questions shouldn't come as any surprise to anyone that's been around CxO level folks before...but they often come as a surprise to many technical people because many think that big data 'just makes sense' and should be implemented immediately. The problem with this line of thinking is that it is the exact same type of thinking that has led organizations down many other non-fruitful paths in the past.

For example, I can think back to my early days in telecom and remember my very first job out of college. I was a software tester working on a new hardware platform that was being designed / built to offload data traffic from the public telephone network (PSTN) onto an ATM network. This was cutting edge stuff at the time during the late 1990's when getting online meant to connect your modem to the PSTN.   The market research had been performed to show that a need existed for this and many discussions where held with technical people at many different telecom service companies. Everything looked great for this particular company until the time came to sell the product.  The CxO level people at these telecom companies were basically asking the questions I've listed above...and the answers weren't compelling enough to warrant an investment in this new, unproven technology.  Sadly, the company I worked for shut down this particular product line after finding no real interest in the product.

Some of you may be thinking that my example is quite different than big data, Sure, there <strong>are</strong> proven examples of big data initiatives bringing fantastic rewards for organizations - but there are also many other <a href=""http://www.cio.com/article/3003538/big-data/study-reveals-that-most-companies-are-failing-at-big-data.html"" target=""_blank"">examples of big data initiative failures</a> so it makes sense that companies are cautious when it comes to new technology /initiatives.

When it comes to your big data initiatives, can you answer the above five questions for your organization?",20160405,http://ericbrown.com/five-things-ceo-wants-know-big-data.htm,Big Data|Featured|Strategy|The New CIO,Big Data|CEO|CIO

The review, titled <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/plantronics-savi-w745-headset-a-review.htm"">Plantronics Savi W745 headset – a review</a>, provided a quick overview of the <a href=""http://amzn.to/25JlGlO"">745 headset </a>and I gave it the following recommendation:
<blockquote>This headset is easy to setup and is crystal clear.  Highly highly recommended. If you have multiple devices like I do, check this headset out…it is worth the money. More than worth the money.</blockquote>
I just wanted to do a follow-up to that review. Here we are a little over 4 years later and the <a href=""http://amzn.to/25JlGlO"" target=""_blank"">Plantronics Savi W745</a> is still going strong without a single problem. The headset has survived a move from Dallas to Tulsa, it has been dropped many times, thrown across the room (accidentally of course), had water spilled on it (more than once) and it just keeps working.

I've got the headset connected to a <a href=""http://amzn.to/1ozqcS1"">Cisco SPA525G VOIP</a> phone, my macbook pro via a usb cable for Skype /facetime calls and my iPhone via bluetooth. When I get a call on one device, all I have to do is hit the 'answer' button on the headset and I'm connected.

I couldn't be happier with the money I spent 4 years ago....and I'm quite surprised that an electronic device purchased 4 years still works.  That's actually the sad part isn't it? I expected to get about a year out of this headset and was happy when I got 2...but 4 years of daily use is phenomenal in the world we live in today.

To second my review from 4 years ago...if you are looking for a headset and have multiple devices, get this Savi headset (or an updated model if they have one...but I don't see any new versions out there).

<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/finding-value-data.htm"">I've said it before</a> - Good data science isn't about finding answers to questions. <strong><em>Good data science is about setting up your data sets, processes and systems to allow you to find more questions</em></strong>.  <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/whats-difference-business-intelligence-big-data.htm"">As I've said before</a>:
<blockquote>Big Data helps you find the questions you don’t know you want to ask.</blockquote>
The designers and data scientists working with the HIV data were working from a similar mindset. From the article:
<blockquote>""We’ve already harmonized the data . . . we’ve lined everything up, put it in the space, made it so you could ask questions you didn’t set out to ask,"" says Dave McColgin, UX design director at Artefact. ""You can sort of stumble into additional questions, if that makes sense.""</blockquote>
This is good data science.

These folks didn't take the data and throw it into a data repository, set up processing systems and technologies and then keep everyone away from it. They didn't hoard the data or the results of any analysis. They opened the data up to everyone to get multiple sets of eyes (and brains) on the data. They focused on data visualization to make it easy to understand and conceptualize the data. They started with the idea that they wanted to see more questions asked then answered. Again...this is good data science.

For those of you who are thinking about data initiatives or currently working with data, make sure you are building your systems and processes to find more questions than answers. Otherwise, you'll be missing out on a good portion of the value of data science.

9643,Can you really win if you aren't the best?,"<img class=""alignleft wp-image-9644 size-medium"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/be-better-300x296.jpg"" alt=""Can you really win if you aren’t the best?"" width=""300"" height=""296"" />People often say that if you work hard and apply yourself, you'll succeed. But lets be realistic....that isn't always true, especially because everybody has a different definition of 'succeed.'   Sure, you can work hard and apply yourself and become better than you were, but it doesn't mean you'll become the 'best' at something.  That's just not how life works.

Let's say, for example, that you decide to become the world's fastest runner in the 100m race. That's a lofty goal, but unless you are born with a very specific set of genes and start training very young, the probability of meeting that goal is pretty low.  That said, <em><strong>there's nothing stopping you from pushing yourself to become faster than you were yesterday or last week</strong></em>.

If you aren't the 'best' at something, does that mean you can't win at that something (or at life)? Not at all. Even the absolute best have bad days.  Underdogs win all the time, which is why you should always continue to improve and become better than you were because you never know when your chance might come to be ready when the 'best' falters.

If you've not seen or read Moneyball (the <a href=""http://amzn.to/236aMlS"">book is here</a>, the <a href=""http://amzn.to/1rzuYBt"">movie is here</a>), you are missing out. The book talks about how the Oakland A's baseball organization took the 'B' players and built a baseball franchise around them.  I don't recall if there were any of baseball's ""best"" players on the Oakland team at the time, but I do recall that there were a lot of the 'also rans' that many teams didn't think were good enough for their team.

Many people will argue that the real story behind Moneyball is how statistics and data analysis can play a really important role in running a business. These people are correct...these things are important and they were an important part of the Moneyball / Oakland A's story, but the part of the story that many miss is that these 'B' players also worked really hard to become better at what they did.  They didn't just relegate themselves to be also-rans...they kept pushing harder and harder to become better than they were.

The same is true for corporations.  Maybe you don't have a team comprised of the most talented and skilled employees, but if you and your leadership team continue to push yourselves and your people, you (and they) can do wonderful things.  If you build a culture of improvement where the smallest failures aren't punished and show your team(s) that you are constantly improving yourself - and expect the same from them - your team and company will be able to compete. You may not win every time, but you'll be around for the long-haul.

You can win if you aren't the best. Anyone can. You may never be considered the best, but if you continue to try to get better, you'll always be better than you were.

That said, just imagine if you don't push yourself or your team to constantly improve? If you and your team are OK with being average, you'll never have the chance to win.",20160427,http://ericbrown.com/can-really-win-b-players.htm,Leadership|Thinking,Leadership|self improvement

<blockquote>Theranos (v): to spin stories that appeal to data while not presenting any data

To be Theranosed is to fall for scammers who tell stories appealing to data but do not present any actual data. This is worse than story time, in which the storyteller starts out with real data but veers off mid-stream into unsubstantiated froth, hoping you and I got carried away by the narrative flow.</blockquote>
I really liked the definition of being 'theranosed', but anyone that's been around long enough knows that this type of activity has occurred for many years and will continue to occur for many more.  In this particular example, a storyteller uses the appeal of data without actually using data to tell a story that led to a multi-billion dollar company valuation.  The people caught up in the story feel like they are being fed data to help back up the story they are being told and gladly go along with the narrative.
<h3>How can you ensure you and your company aren't ""theranosed""?</h3>
Well...I'm not sure you can be 100% safe from being spun stories without data, but you can build a culture of curiosity and questioning that almost ensures that at least someone in your company asks the right question and/or sees through the story being spun.

Additionally, you can build a strong data culture within your business.  Understanding how to use data to make decisions and tell stories can help you spot someone trying to ""theranose"" you. Understanding what it takes to analyze data and build meaningful stories with data will help you see through someone else's BS  very quickly.

If you teams ask questions and dig into the data, you can be sure that you've do everything possible to minimize the possibilities of being ""theranosed.""",20160523,http://ericbrown.com/dont-get-theranosed.htm,Big Data,data|Storytelling
9656,What digital projects should you be chasing?,"<img class=""alignleft wp-image-9657 size-medium"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/digital-marketing-300x210.png"" alt=""Chasing Digital Projects"" width=""300"" height=""210"" />I was talking to a CMO today about their current and future plans for digital projects. We were talking about data analytics, customer experience, technology, social media and other topics when the CMO asked what the 'next' project or technology that she and her team should be chasing.

She asked:
<blockquote>We've talked about all data, social, digital transformation, the cloud and everything else...but what should I really be focused on? What projects should my team be chasing for the future?</blockquote>
I couldn't give exact types of projects that her team should be focused on, but I did share my thoughts on the only area that I think make sense for marketing teams to focus on.

That's right...just one area.  If you are going to chase digital, you should chase it in this one area.

<strong><em>The only area marketing teams should be focused on (and chasing) is in improving the experience for your customers.</em></strong> That might be SEO projects, data analytics or a new application, but by focusing on the customer experience, the marketing team is focused on one of the most important aspects of a business. <a href=""http://blog.clientheartbeat.com/why-customer-experience-is-important/"" target=""_blank"">Customer experience is the key to driving engagement and growth</a> for a business and has been called '<a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/56447/customer-experience"" target=""_blank"">the next competitive battleground</a>.'

If a project doesn't touch the customer experience, there needs to be a very thorough discussion of whether that project is worth taking time and money away from your customer facing digital projects.  There are times when marketing teams need to take on non-customer facing projects, but you shouldn't be out there looking for those projects or chasing those technologies. Let those technologies and projects come to you.
<h4><strong>Chase the projects that are focused on improving the customer experience.</strong></h4>
Whether that is engaging your clients better, improve customer service or eliminating a pain point for clients, those projects will improve your customer experience.

Beyond the customer experience, there are other projects that CMO's can focus on and chase, but I'd argue that anytime you are working on these types of projects, you are not directly improving the customer experience.    There are always going to be knew digital projects and new technologies, but for the CMO and the marketing team, the customer experience should top of mind and a major filter for all new projects and technologies.

Finally, when a new technology or buzzword comes along, take a step back from all the buzz and ask yourself and your team(s) how that technology or approach will improve the customer experience and build competitive advantage for your organization. If that new tech or buzzword doesn't drive customer experience, you probably shouldn't chase it.",20160713,http://ericbrown.com/chasing-digital-projects.htm,Big Data|Digital|Thinking,CMO|Marketing|Marketing Technology
9659,Data Analytics - Prescriptive vs Descriptive,"<img class=""alignleft wp-image-9660 size-medium"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/data_analytics2-300x145.png"" alt=""Data Analytics - Prescriptive vs Descriptive"" width=""300"" height=""145"" />You've collected tons of data. You've got terabytes and terabytes of data. You are happy because you've got data. But, what are you going to do with that data?You'll analyze it of course. But how are you going to analyze it and what are you going to do with that analysis? How does data analytics come into play?

Will you use your data to predict service outages or will you use your data to describe those service outages? Your answer to the 'how' and the 'what' questions are important to the success of your big data initiatives.
<h3>Two different approaches to Data Analytics</h3>
There are two basic approaches to data analytics - descriptive and prescriptive. Some folks out there might add a third type called 'predictive,' but I feel like predictive and prescriptive are built on top of one other (prescriptive requires predictive) - so i tend to lump prescriptive and predictive analytics together while others keep them separated.

Let's dig into the two different types of analytics.
<h4><strong>Descriptive analytics</strong></h4>
Descriptive analytics are pretty much what they sound like. Using statistical analysis, you 'describes' and summarizes the data using simple and complex statistical analysis techniques.   Using aggregation, filtering and statistical methods, data is described using counts, means, sums, percentages, min/max values and other descriptive values to help you (and others) understand the data.  <strong><em>Descriptive analytics can tell you what has happened or what is happening now.</em></strong>
<h4><strong>Prescriptive analytics</strong></h4>
Prescriptive analytics are based on modeling data to understand what could happen and, eventually recommend what the next step should be based on previous steps taken.  Using data modeling, machine learning and complex statistical methods, analysts can build models to forecast possible outcomes (e.g., forecasting inventory levels in a store). From that model, additional data can be fed back into the model (i.e., a feedback loop) to then build a prescriptive model to help users determine what you should do given a particular forecast and/or action that occurs.  <strong><em>Prescriptive analytics can help you understand what might happen as well as help you make a decision about how to react.</em></strong>

Both approaches to data analytics are important. You must use descriptive analytics to understand your data. To make that data useful, you should use prescriptive (and/or predictive) analytics to understand how changes within your dataset can change your business.

<strong><em>To use the 'data -&gt; information -&gt; knowledge' <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_Pyramid"" target=""_blank"">construct</a>, descriptive analytics gets you some information while prescriptive (and/or predictive) gets you into realm of knowledge.</em></strong>
<h3>Are you Descriptive or Prescriptive?</h3>
In my experience most people today are stuck in the descriptive analytics realm. They are filtering, measuring and analyzing terabytes of data. They understand their data better than anyone ever and they can point to new measures and knowledge gained from this analysis.  That said, they are missing out on quite a lot of value by not diving into prescriptive (and/or predictive) analytical approaches.

When I run across 'data scientists' (using the term liberally), I always ask about modeling, forecasting and decision support techniques.  Many (most) look at me like I'm crazy. They then drive the conversation back towards the things they know about. Filtering, averaging, analyzing, describing data.  They can tell me things like 'average social shares' and 'click-through-rates' but they can't tell me much more than that.  These are absolutely necessary and good pieces of information for an organization to have, but until they are put into action and used for something, they'll not turn into 'knowledge.'

Prescriptive analytics is much more involved than descriptive analytics. Just about anyone can do descriptive analytics with the right amount of tools.  Prescriptive analytics is where you find the real tried and true data scientists. They are the ones building models, testing those models and then putting those models into use within an organization to help drive business activity.

If you are 'doing' big data and are only doing descriptive analytics, you aren't seeing the entire value of big data and data analytics. You need to find a way to move into prescriptive (and/or predictive) analytics quickly.",20160719,http://ericbrown.com/data-analytics-prescriptive-vs-descriptive.htm,Big Data|Data Science|Featured,Big Data|data analytics|descriptive analytics|prescriptive analytics
9663,Data Analytics - The importance of Data Preparation,"<img class=""alignleft wp-image-9664 size-medium"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/CIO-Crossing-the-gap-to-big-data-2-300x169.png"" alt=""Data Preparation"" width=""300"" height=""169"" />How many of you would go sky diving without learning all the necessary precautions and safety measures necessary to keep you alive? How many of you would let your kid drive your car without first teaching them the basics of driving?  While not as life-and-death as the above questions, data preparation is just as important to proper data analytics as learning the basics of driving before getting behind a wheel.

Experienced data scientists will tell you data prep is (almost) everything and is the area that they spend the majority of their time.  <a href=""http://bluehillresearch.com/quantifying-the-case-for-enhanced-data-preparation/"" target=""_blank"">Blue Hill research reports</a> that data analysts spend <em>at least 2 hours per day</em> in data preparation activities.  At 2 hours per day, <a href=""http://bluehillresearch.com/attaching-dollars-to-data-prep/"" target=""_blank"">Blue Hill estimates</a> that it costs about <em>$22,000 per year per data analyst</em> to prepare data for use in data analytics activities.

One of the reasons that prep takes up so much time is that it is generally a very manual process. You can throw tons of technology and systems at your data, but the front-end of the data analytics workflow is still very manual.  While there are automated tools available to help with data preparation, this step in the process is still a very manual process.

Data preparation is important. But...what exactly is it?
<h4>The Importance of Data Preparation</h4>
Data prep is really nothing more than making sure your data meets the needs of your plans for that data. Data needs to be high quality, describable and in a format that is easily used in future analysis and has some context included around the data.

There's tons of ways to 'do' data preparation. You can use databases, scripts, data management systems or just plain old excel. In fact, <a href=""http://bluehillresearch.com/quantifying-the-case-for-enhanced-data-preparation/"" target=""_blank"">according to Blue Hill</a>, 78% of analysts use excel for the majority of their data preparation work. Interestingly, 89% of those same analysts claim that they use excel for the majority of their entire data analytics workflow.

As I mentioned before, there are some tools / systems out there today to help with data prep, but they are still in their infancy. One of these companies, <a href=""http://www.paxata.com/"" target=""_blank"">Paxata</a>, is doing some very interesting stuff with data preparation, but I think we are a few years off before these types of tools become widespread.

Data preparation is integral to successful data analytics projects. To do it right, it takes a considerable amount of time and can often take the majority of a data analyst's time. Whether you use excel, databases or a fancy system to help you with data prep, just remember the importance of data preparation.

If you don't prepare your data correctly, your data analytics may fail miserable. The old saying of ""garbage in, garbage out"" definitely applies here.

How focused are you on data preparation within your organization?",20160726,http://ericbrown.com/data-analytics-data-preparation.htm,Big Data|Data Science|Featured,Big Data|data analytics|data preparation|data science

Earlier this week, my beloved 740 died.  I'm not quite sure what happened but it just stopped working.  Mind you, it was only 4+ years old...which is something you really don't see much of these days.

For a few minutes, I looked around at different models but Plantronics seems to have kept the 740 as their base model with only minor changes (mostly on how the earpiece is configured). I also looked at a competing product from Jabra (the <a href=""http://amzn.to/2aacJPR"" target=""_blank"">Jabra 9470</a>) but just couldn't bring myself to move away from a device that has worked for me for 4+ years.

So...I ordered another one. It arrived today and I plugged it in, let it charge and went right back to using the best multi-device headset on the market.

9668,"Data Analytics - Data Modeling, a Necessary first step","<img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-9672"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/images.jpg"" alt=""Data Analytics - Data Modeling, a Necessary first step"" width=""275"" height=""183"" />What do you think of when you hear the term 'data modeling'?

Just typing 'data modeling' almost made me go to sleep.  Who am I kidding...I'm a data geek and this stuff is interesting...but some folks aren't quite as excited by this stuff as I am.

Data modeling has many different definitions and connotations.  For many within the IT world, data modeling conjures up database administrators sitting in room designing tables and relationships. That type of thing does make me sleepy...but it is a necessary step in any data storage workflow <em>and</em> in your data strategy.

Oh. What's that? You don't have a data strategy?

Well...You need one.

Here's why: <em>Much like business strategy, data strategy provides guidance into how your organization is going to capture, manage, use and integrate your data into your business.  Business strategy helps inform and guide data strategy while your data strategy helps you build better business strategies and tactics.</em>

I'll assume you have a data strategy in place. Because you do need one before you dive into data modeling.  Sure, you can build data models without any type of strategy but I can guarantee you those models will be changed multiple times over time since they weren't informed by any strategic thinking.

Like I mentioned before, data modeling has many different definitions, many of which are very technical and beyond the scope of this short post but I will provide the steps that I like to use for data modeling.   Data Modeling consists of the following steps:
<ul>
 	<li>Understanding your business strategies, tactics and needs</li>
 	<li>Understanding what data you have and who might use it in the future</li>
 	<li>Understanding where your data comes from (and where it might be going)</li>
 	<li>Understanding the context of your data</li>
 	<li>Ensuring data quality, consistency and governance</li>
 	<li>Ensuring proper metadata is included with your data</li>
</ul>
These seem pretty straightforward (and they are) but these steps are the key steps needed to undertake a data project.  These aren't earth-shattering revelations about how to do data modeling, but making sure these steps are covered in every data modeling project has helped me, my colleagues and my clients build some great data models, which led to great outcomes from the data we had.

If you don't take the time understand your data, how do you know that the analytics that you build with that data is accurate?  You don't.  Spend the necessary time in the modeling phase of your next data project and you may be surprised at the quality of the output of your <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/data-analytics-data-preparation.htm"">data analytics</a>.",20160810,http://ericbrown.com/data-analytics-data-modeling.htm,Big Data|Data Science,data analytics|data modeling

I hear people talking (and writing) about big data today. There are some folks out there that take a very common sense approach to big data, but quite a few have gone 'ga ga' over big data.

Blogs and articles are written that describe the utopia that big data can bring to an organization.  They talk about how great big data is and what great things big data can bring.  For the most part, <em>these people are right</em>. Big Data can bring great returns on the investments into the technology, systems and people...but <strong>big data isn't the answer</strong>.  Big data isn't about finding answers...<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/good-data-science-isnt-about-finding-answers-to-questions.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">big data is all about finding more questions</a>.

9701,Your data project is going to fail,"<img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-9713"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/failure.png"" alt=""Your data project is going to fail"" width=""276"" height=""200"" />I hate to be the bearer of bad news....but your data project is going to fail.

Maybe not the one you're working on today. Maybe not the one you're starting next month. Heck, maybe not the one you don't even know about yet...but at some point in the future - if you stay in the data world long enough -<em><strong> y</strong><strong>our data project is going to fail.</strong></em>

There are may ways your data project could fail. Martin Goodson shares his thoughts on <a href=""http://www.martingoodson.com/ten-ways-your-data-project-is-going-to-fail/"">Ten Ways your project could fail</a>, and I've seen failure's driven by each of Martin's ""ten ways"" during my career. The most spectacular failures have come from the lack of clear strategy for any data projects.

It should be common sense in the business world that if you don't have a strategy and plan to execute that strategy in place, you are going to have a hard time. When I use the word 'strategy', I don't just mean some over-arching plan that somebody has written up because they think '<a href=""http://www.martingoodson.com/ten-ways-your-data-project-is-going-to-fail/"">data is the new oil</a>' and by 'doing' data projects they'll somehow magically make the business bigger / better / richer / strong /etc.

Data projects are just like any other project. Imagine you need to move your data center...you wouldn't just start unplugging servers and loading them into your car to drive to the new data center, would you?

Would you go and spend $20 million to hire a brand new sales team without building a thorough strategic plan for how that sales team will do what they need to do?  You wouldn't hire the people, on-board them and then say 'start making phone calls' without planning sales territories, building 'go to market' plans and building other tactical plans to outline how the team will execute on your strategy would you?  Scratch that...I know some companies that have done that (and they failed miserably).

Data projects require just as much strategic thinking and planning as any other type of project. Just because your CEO (or CIO or CMO or ...) read an article about machine learning doesn't mean you should run out and start spending money on machine learning. Most of you are probably nodding along with me. I can hear you thinking ""this is common sense....tell me something I don't know.""  But let me tell you...in my experience, it isn't common sense because I see it happen all the time with my clients.

So we agree that if you don't have a strategy, your data project is going to fail, right? Does that mean if you do the strategic planning process correctly, you'll be swimming in the deep end of data success in the future?<em> Maybe. Maybe not.</em> The strategic plan isn't everything. If you were successful because you planned well, then every company that ever hired McKinsey would be #1 in their industry with no hope of ever being surpassed by their competitors.

After you've spent some time on the strategy of your data project(s), you've got to spend time on the execution phase of your project.  This is where having the right people, the right systems / technologies in place to 'do' the data work comes into play.  Again, every one of you is probably nodding right now and thinking something like ""sure you need those things!""  But this is another area that companies fall down time and time again. They kick off data projects without having the right people analyzing the data and the right people / systems supporting the projects.

Take a look at Martin's ""<a href=""http://www.martingoodson.com/ten-ways-your-data-project-is-going-to-fail/"">Ten Ways</a>"" again, specifically #3.  I watched a project get derailed because the VP of IT wouldn't approve the installation of R Studio and other tools onto each of the team member's computers.  That team spent three weeks waiting to get the necessary tools installed on their machines before they could get started diving into any data.  This is an extreme case of course, but things like this happen regularly in my experience.

Hiring the best people and building / buying the best systems aren't enough either. You need to have a good 'data culture', meaning you have to have people that understand data, understand how to use data. Additionally, your organization needs to understand the <strong>dichotomy of data - it is both important and not important at the same time</strong>.     Yes data is important and yes data projects are important, but without all the other things combined (people, strategy, systems, process, etc), data is just data.  Data is meaningless unless you convert it to information (and then convert it yet again into knowledge).  To convert data, you need a company culture that allows people the freedom to 'convert' data into information / knowledge.

So...you think you have the best strategy, people, systems, process and culture, yes?  You think you've done everything right and your data projects are set up for success. I hate to tell you, but your data project is going to fail. If you have the right strategy, people, systems, process and culture in place, you aren't guaranteed success but you will be in a much better position to recover from that failure.",20161129,http://ericbrown.com/your-data-project-is-going-to-fail.htm,Big Data|Featured|Leadership,Big Data|failure
9703,Data Analytics & Python (Cross Post),"<em>Crosspost - This post first appeared on <a href=""http://pythondata.com"">Python Data</a> as <a href=""http://pythondata.com/data-analytics-python/"">Data Analytics &amp; Python</a>.</em>

<img class=""alignleft wp-image-9706 size-medium"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screenshot-2016-11-11-08.00.23-300x113.png"" alt=""Data Analytics &amp; Python"" width=""300"" height=""113"" />So you want (or need) to analyze some data. You've got some data in an excel spreadsheet or database somewhere and you've been asked to take that data and do something useful with it. Maybe its time for data analytics &amp; Python?

Maybe you've been asked to build some models for predictive analytics. Maybe you've been asked to better understand your customer base based on their previous purchases and activity.  Perhaps you've been asked to build a new business model to generate new revenue.

Where do you start?

You could go out and spend a great deal of money on systems to help you in your analytics efforts, or you could start with tools that are available to you already.  You could open up excel, which is very much overlooked by people these days for data analytics. Or...you could install open source tools (for free!) and begin hacking away.

When I was in your shoes in my first days playing around with data, I started with excel. I quickly moved on to other tools because the things I needed to do seemed difficult to accomplish in excel. I then installed <a href=""https://www.r-project.org/about.html"" target=""_blank"">R</a> and began to learn 'real' data analytics (or so I thought).

I liked (and still do like) R, but it never felt like 'home' to me.  After a few months poking around in R, I ran across <a href=""https://www.python.org/"" target=""_blank"">python</a> and fell in love. Python felt like home to me.

With python, I could quickly cobble together a script to do just about anything I needed to do. In the 5+ years I've been working with python now, I've not found anything that I cannot do with python and freely available modules.

Need to do some time series analysis and/or forecasting? Python and <a href=""http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/"" target=""_blank"">statsmodels</a> (along with others).

Need to do some natural language processing?  Python and <a href=""http://www.nltk.org/"" target=""_blank"">NLTK</a> (along with others).

Need to do some machine learning work? Python and <a href=""http://scikit-learn.org/stable/"" target=""_blank"">sklearn</a> (along with others).

You don't HAVE to use python for data analysis. R is perfectly capable of doing the same things python is - and in some cases, R has more capabilities than python does because its been used an analytics tool for much longer than python has.

That said, I prefer python and use python in everything I do. Data analytics &amp; python go together quite well.

9716,You (probably) don't need Machine Learning,"<img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-9765"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/The-word-no-in-red-stamp-300x200.jpg"" alt=""Your company doesn't need Machine Learning (probably)"" width=""300"" height=""200"" />Statistically speaking, you and/or your company really <strong>don't need machine learning</strong>.

By 'statistically speaking', I mean that most companies today have no absolutely no need for machine learning (ML). The majority of problems that companies want to throw at machine learning are fairly straightforward problems that can be 'solved' with a form of regression.  They may not be the simple linear regression of your Algebra 1 class, but they are probably nonetheless regression problems. Robin Hanson summed up these thoughts recently when he tweeted the following:

https://twitter.com/robinhanson/status/803302419249725440

Of particular note is the 'cleaned-up data' piece.  That's huge and something that many companies forget (or ignore) when working with their data. Without proper <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/data-analytics-data-preparation.htm"">data quality</a>, <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/data-analytics-data-modeling.htm"">data governance</a> and <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/big-data-starts-data-management.htm"">data management</a> processes / systems, you'll most likely fall into the Garbage in / Garbage out trap that has befallen many data projects.

Now, I'm not a data management / data quality guru. Far from it.  For that, you want people like <a href=""http://www.ocdqblog.com/home"">Jim Harris</a> and <a href=""http://hubdesigns.com/management"">Dan Power</a>, but I know enough about the topic(s) to know what bad (or non-existent) data management looks like - and I see it often in organizations. In my experiences working with organizations wanting to kick off new data projects (and most today are talking about machine learning and deep learning), the first question I always ask is ""tell me about your data management processes."" If they can't adequately describe these processes, they aren't ready for machine learning.  Over the last five years, I'd guess that 75% of the time the response to my data management query is ""well, we have some of our data stored in a database and other data stored on file shares with proper permissions.""  <em>This isn't data management...it's data storage.</em>

If you and/or your organization don't have good, clean data, you are most definitely not ready for machine learning.  Data management should be your first step before diving into any other data project(s).
<h3>What if you have good data management?</h3>
A small minority of the organizations I've worked with do have proper master data management processes in place. They really understand how important quality, governance and management is to good data and good analysis. If your company understand this importance, congratulations...you're a few steps ahead of many others.

Let me caution you thought. Just because you have good, clean data doesn't mean you can or should jump into machine learning. Of course you <em><strong>can</strong></em> jump into it I guess, but you most likely don't need to.

Out of all the companies I've worked with over the last five years, I'd say about 90% of the problems that were initially tagged for machine learning were solved with some fairly standard regression approaches. It always seems to come as a surprise to clients when I recommend simple regression to solve a 'complex' problem when they had their heart set on building out multiple machine learning (ML) / deep learning (DL) models.   I always tell them that they <em><strong>could</strong></em> go the machine learning route - and their <em><strong>may</strong><strong> be some value</strong></em> in that approach - but wouldn't it be nice to know what basic modeling / regression can do for you to be able to know whether ML / DL is doing anything better than basic regression?
<h3>But...I want to use machine learning!</h3>

9731,A tale of two employees,"<img class=""alignleft wp-image-9732 size-medium"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/08-31-2015_Tale-of-Two-Employees-249x300.jpg"" alt=""a tale of two employees"" width=""249"" height=""300"" />I was recently talking to a CIO friend of mine.  She has a really good team of people working for her and has recently gone through a hiring spell where she has six new-ish employees on her staff. All six have been at the company from anywhere between 1 month to 7 months.

While talking to this CIO, she was relating some stories of a few of these employees. She was telling me of a recent experience that has her rethinking the employment of one of these new people.

The first of these we'll call Joe for discussion purposes. Joe's resume is spectacular (I've seen it) and his experience over his career seem to be perfect for someone on the 'fast track' to move up through a company.  Additionally, the recommendations from previous employers are some of the best that I've seen.   He's a rockstar on paper.

The CIO also told me of another employee. We'll call him Bill for ease of discussion.  On paper, Bill is an average employee. His resume looks good and his experience over his career shows an employee who goes to work and does his job and goes home. There's nothing that screams ""high achiever"" with Bill, but he's a good employee. An average employee, but a good one.

Apparently, things came to a head over a recent holiday.  As is usual, during this holiday, there were some folks from the IT operations group on call in case something happened at the office.  That's the life of IT operations.

During this holiday, one of the people on call got an alert about one of their systems. She dutifully logged into the VPN and started reading the logs.  Apparently, the problem was one that required a broader call-out of other team members to resolve, so she sent out there messages to the other on-call team members to start fixing this issue. Neither Joe nor Bill was as part of the on-call team members.

As the team began working through the issue, they realized that they would need to bring someone in from the development team brought to make sure some of the configuration changes they were making wouldn't affect some of the software platforms. They reached out to the head of development and asked him who they should reach out to.

The director of development reached out to both Bill and Joe via text message to ask for some help. Within a few minutes, he had received responses from both employees. I've paraphrased them below.

From Bill:
<blockquote>Happy to help. Should I come into the office? Tell me who to reach out to.</blockquote>
From Joe:
<blockquote>Its a holiday. Why are you asking me to work?</blockquote>
Here we have ""Joe the Rockstar"" unwilling to put in a little extra time and effort and ""Bill the Average"" willing to do what he needs to do to get the job done.

Which of these employees has my CIO friend rethinking their employment?  A 'rockstar' on paper means little of that person isn't able or willing to get the job done.

I would LOVE for magic to be involved in data analytics. I could then whip up a couple of spells and say ""abra cadabra' and have my data tell me something meaningful.  But that's not how it works.You can say fancy incantations all day long, but your data is going to be meaningless until you do some work on it.

This 'work' that you need to do involves lots of very unglamorous activities. Lots of data munging and manipulation. Lots of trial and error and a whole lot of ""well that didn't work!""

Data science requires a systematic approach to collecting, cleaning, storing and analysis data.  Without 'science', you don't have anything but a lot of data.

Let's take a look at what the word 'science' means. <a href=""http://www.dictionary.com/browse/science"">Dictionary.com defines ""science"" as</a>:

You'll notice that the word 'magic' isn't included anywhere in that definition but the word 'systematic' shows up a few times. While we're at it, let's take a look at a definition of data science (from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science"">Wikipedia</a>):
<blockquote>an interdisciplinary field about scientific methods, processes and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured</blockquote>
</div>
Again...nothing about 'abra cadabra' in there.

If you want to ""do' data science correctly, you have to do the hard work. You have to follow some form of systematic process(es) to get your data, clean your data, understand your data and then use that data to test out some hypotheses.

Doing data science without 'science' is nothing more than throwing darts at a dart board and thinking the results are meaningful.

9740,Who Owns Risk?,"<img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-9741"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/url.jpg"" alt=""Who owns risk"" width=""259"" height=""194"" /><em>This is a guest post from Christine Sato</em>

Proper risk management is vital to any project manager. Any big project is sure to have a great deal of risk, which needs to be identified and evaluated. The ability to accurately identify the risk factors and gauge the stakes of a given project is instrumental to proper management of that project.

It is safe to say that the management of risk is the job of a project manager, but who owns the risk? The concept of risk ownership is a tricky one, with a few potential answers.
<h3><strong>Defining Risk</strong></h3>
Risk, as it applies to project management, is any element of uncertainty in a project. This can take the form of negative risks, or threats, and positive risks, or opportunities. Among these risks are known risks which can be planned for, and unknown risks which require adaptability to manage.

The project manager is responsible for risk management, which entails identifying the positive and negative risks, planning for known risks, and quickly adapting to unknown risks as they arise. They usually have the final say in risk management, but they can delegate some aspects of the risk management process through assigning owners to risk.
<h3><strong>Project Management and Risk Ownership</strong></h3>
Risk ownership, as it applies to project management, is mostly about assigning portions of risk to individuals. When these individuals are delegated ownership of risk, it doesn’t literally mean they own the risk; that would be the organization or individual that provides the capital. Rather, risk owners, as delegated by the project manager, are usually those who have intimate knowledge of the risk in question, and have a large amount of influence over its outcome. The ‘ownership’ in this definition of risk ownership means that they must own the consequences of the risk, meant in the same way that one owns their mistakes.
<h3><strong>Aspects of Delegated Risk Ownership:</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Identifying threats</li>
 	<li>Identifying impact</li>
 	<li>Assigning responsibility</li>
 	<li>Implementation of risk response</li>
 	<li>Reporting risk</li>
 	<li>Identifying risk interdependence</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Bearing Risk Vs. Owning Risk</strong></h3>
The literal owners of risk, the ones who financially back the project in question, are referred to as risk bearers instead of risk owners. The risk bearers could be the board of directors, an individual entrepreneur, angel investor, or other financial backer. Since these individuals are the ones bankrolling the project, they can be said to literally ‘own’ the risk, and will usually have the final say on any decisions made by the project manager. However, for the purposes of project management, these individuals are referred to as risk bearers, with the ones managing the risk being risk owners. In some cases, risk bearers can also be risk owners: for example, a member of the board of directors can be assigned ownership of one aspect of risk by a project manager.
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
Risks are part and parcel of any serious undertaking. Any business project is a roll of the dice, and the project manager is responsible for weighing the odds. In this aspect, risk ownership can be defined in three ways, with three groups of risk owners. Individual team members own specific aspects of the risk, requiring them to accurately monitor and mitigate them. The suppliers of capital and resources literally own the risk, seeing as they are the ones with the most at stake.

Lastly, the project manager has the most important role, owning risk as the final say in the risk-making process. They are responsible for taking the input from individual risk owners, weighing it against the desires of the risk bearers, and owning the final consequences of their decision.

You know the one.  Napoleon's brother is getting married and sings a song to his bride. I'd link you to a video of that awesome song but none that I found seem to have audio, so I'll just link you to the <a href=""http://houseoflyrics.com/lyrics/napoleon_dynamite/lafawnduhs_song.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">lyrics</a>.  The lyrics don't do the scene justice...you have to watch it if you haven't (and watch it again if you've already seen it).

The part of the song that sticks with me is these lyrics:
<blockquote>Yes, I love technology
But not as much as you, you see
But I still love technology
Always and forever</blockquote>
I'm a geek. No question about it. When I first watched that scene and heard the song, I loved it.  I too love technology.  I've been able to do a lot in my life / career because of technology.

But...technology isn't what we should be 'loving'.  We should like technology, but we should love the things that technology can do for our coworkers, for our companies and for our customers (and for our lives).

You see, technology is just a means to an end.  Technology isn't the answer...it never has been.  Many people will tell you to solve your problem(s) with technology, but the technology itself is meaningless unless your solution(s) are focused on the end-goal of maintaining revenue, customer satisfaction, employee morale, etc.

I can't count how many times over the last few years I've heard someone say ""just throw Hadoop at that dataset"" or ""just move your systems to the cloud"" as if that was the answer to a problem or problems. Now, they MIGHT be the answer, but we need to make sure we understand the problem entirely before throwing technology at it.

Yes. I do love technology, but not as much as I love solving the real problem(s) that my clients have rather than just covering them up with technological band-aids.",20170710,http://ericbrown.com/technology-band-aid-rather-than-solution.htm,Technology,
9755,Driving Digital by Isaac Sacolick - a book review,"<img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-9756"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/51eZ8xbPL-199x300.jpg"" alt=""Driving Digital: The Leader's Guide to Business Transformation Through Technology"" width=""199"" height=""300"" />I just finished <a href=""http://amzn.to/2eFvzwM"">Driving Digital: The Leader's Guide to Business Transformation Through Technology</a> by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaacsacolick/"">Isaac Sacolick</a>. <em>Note: I received a free copy of this book for review.</em>

The short review:

<em><strong>Excellent...the best book I've read on the subject.</strong></em> Go buy it if you want/need to transform your business.

The long review:

I've read a number of books on digital transformation over the years. Many were very good, some weren't.  Most were very theoretical who's authors spend their time talking about the importance of digital transformation to a business but I can't recall one single book (other than the one being reviewed) that provided an actual game-plan for driving digital transformation.

Don't get me wrong - there's lots of theory in this book about <em>WHY</em> companies need to transform their organization but just as importantly (or maybe more importantly) there is more discussion of <em>HOW</em> to drive this transformation.

If you don't know Isaac<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaacsacolick/"">,</a> you should check out his <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaacsacolick/"">linkedin profile</a> and <a href=""http://www.starcio.com/"">his website</a>. He's spent years doing exactly what he writes about in this book.  He's learned the hard way about how to transform an organization by actually doing it rather than sitting in a consulting practice and talking to people that have done it.  Toward the beginning of the book, you can see just how well Isaac understands digital transformation with the following statement (from page 13):
<blockquote>Digital transformation is not just about technology and its implementation. It’s about looking at the business strategy through the lens of technical capabilities and how that changes how you are operating and generating revenues....Ultimately, digital transformation is about automating more of operations, generating revenue-leveraging digital capabilities, and bringing new convenience and value to customers.</blockquote>
I spent the majority of the time reading this book nodding my head and highlighting passages. My kindle notebook for this book has over 100 highlights, which is rare for me while reading these types of books.  Isaac has filled the pages of this book with quite a lot of practical knowledge worth more than the cost of the book.

One of the major aspects of this book that I really like is the very descriptive nature of HOW a CIO can begin driving digital using agile.  I'm a <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/?s=agile"">big fan of agile</a> and I'm a fan of <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/agility-and-the-new-cio.htm"">agility</a> so seeing Isaac talk about agile practices makes me happy. He writes:
<blockquote>The first place to start is to develop the organizational model and practices that enable the executing of a digital agenda driven by customer and market feedback. You need the IT organization to learn agile practices and develop an agile culture.</blockquote>
A reader can read those lines and think ""I just need to implement agile and we'll be able to drive digital transformation!"" -- and they'll be wrong. Agile is just part of it.  Thankfully, Isaac follows up with the following:
<blockquote>...agile is a practice, and it by itself isn’t going to make the IT team fully capable to solve transformational challenges.</blockquote>
Agile (or any method) isn't the answer to anything other than how can we get this project completed. That said, agility within the organization (and within the IT group) is absolutely necessary for transformation of any kind, especially digital transformation and Isaac does a phenomenal job outlining how do drive digital transformation using agile practices in this book.  This book is both a descriptive and a prescriptive look at driving digital and should be at the top of your reading list. <a href=""http://amzn.to/2eFvzwM"">Go buy it</a>.

9757,Data and Culture go hand in hand,"Last week, I spent an afternoon talking to the CEO of a mid-sized services company.  He's interested in 'big data' and is interviewing possible consultants / companies to help his organization 'take advantage of their data'.    The conversation was a good one, although it went down a path he didn't expect it to go down.

Our conversation started out like they always do in these types of meetings. He started asking me about big data, how big data can help companies and what big data would mean to their organization.  As I always do, I tried to provide a very direct and non-sales focused message to the CEO about the pros/cons of big data, data science and what it means to be a <a href=""http://ericbrown.com/data-driven-or-data-informed.htm"">data-informed organization.</a>

This particular CEO stopped me when I started talking about using data to make decisions and told that his organization is a 'data-driven company!' (the exclamation was implied in the forcefulness of his comment).  He described how they have have been using data for years to make decisions.  He showed me sales literature that touts their data-driven culture and described how they were one of the first companies in their space to really use data to drive their business.

After about 10 minutes of exclaiming the virtues of his data-driven organization, I asked the CEO a simple question:
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">""You say this is a data-driven organization...but every one of your managers tells me that most decisions in the organization are made by 'gut feel', especially if you're involved. That's not a data-driven organization...that's a</p>

Take a Look at Your Data</a>, I discuss the importance of data quality and data management in an organization's digital transformation efforts.  That article can be summarized with the closing paragraph (but feel free to go read the full version):
<blockquote>To speed up your transformation projects and initiatives, you need to take a long, hard look at your data. Good data management and governance practices will put you a step ahead of companies that don’t yet view their data as a strategic asset.</blockquote>
I wanted to highlight this, because it continues to be the biggest issue I find when working with clients today. Many organizations have people that are interested in data and they are finding the budget to get their team's up to speed on data analytics and data science...but they are still missing the boat on the basics of good data management and data quality.
<h3>What is data quality?</h3>
<a href=""https://www.informatica.com/services-and-training/glossary-of-terms/data-quality-definition.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Informatica defines data quality in the following manner</a>:
<blockquote>Data quality refers to the overall utility of a dataset(s) as a function of its ability to be easily processed and analyzed for other uses, usually by a database, data warehouse, or data analytics system. ... To be of high quality, data must be <strong>consistent and unambiguous</strong>. Data quality issues are often the result of database merges or systems/cloud integration processes in which data fields that should be compatible are not due to schema or format inconsistencies</blockquote>
<strong>Emphasis mine.</strong>

Not a bad definition. My definition of data quality is:
<blockquote>Data quality is both simultaneously a measurement and a state of your data. It describes the <i>consistency</i>, <em>availability</em>, <em>reliability</em>, <em>usability</em>, <em>relevancy</em>, <em>security</em> and <em>audibility</em> of your data.</blockquote>
Now, some may argue that this definition covers data management and data governance more than data quality...and they may be correct...but I've found that most people that aren't 'data people' get really confused (and bored) when you start throwing lots of different terms out there at them so I try to cover as much of the master data management world under data quality. I've found its more relatable to most folks when you talk about 'data quality' vs 'data governance', etc.
<h3>Data quality in the real world</h3>
Last month, I spoke to the CEO and CIO of a medium sized company about a new data initiative they are planning.  The project is a great idea for them and should lead to some real growth in both revenue and data sophistication. While I won't go into the specifics, they are looking to spend a little over $5 million in the next two years to bring data to the forefront of all of their decision making process.

While listening to their pitch (yes...they were pitching me...I'm not used to that) I asked one my 'go-to' questions related to data quality. I asked:  ""Can you tell me about your data quality processes/systems?"" They asked me to explain what I meant by data quality. I provided my definition and spent a few minutes discussing the need for data quality.  We spoke for an hour about data management, data quality and data governance. We discussed how each of these would 'fit' into their data initiative(s) and what additional steps they need to take before they go full-speed into the data world.

Early today I had a follow up conversation with the CEO. She told me that they are moving forward with their data initiative with a fairly large change - the first step is implementing proper data management / quality processes and systems.   Thankfully for this organization both the CEO and CIO are smart enough to realize how important data quality is and how important having quality data to feed into their analysis process/systems is for trusting that analysis that comes from their data.

As I said in the CIO.com article: 'Good data management and governance practices will put you a step ahead of companies that don’t yet view their data as a strategic asset.' This CEO / CIO pair definitly see data as a strategic asset and are willing to do what it takes to make quality, governance and data management a part of their organization.",20170918,http://ericbrown.com/data-quality-most-important-data-dimension.htm,Big Data|Featured|The New CIO,data governance|data management|data science

This really spoke to me.

One of the things I dislike about many business books is that they try to create dogma and that readers should follow their 'recipe' and you're business will be 'great'.  Much like Isaac Sacolick's <a href=""http://amzn.to/2eFvzwM"">Driving Digital</a> (see my review of<a href=""http://ericbrown.com/driving-digital-isaac-sacolick.htm""> Isaac's book here</a>), Scott doesn't do that with his book...instead he's telling people to stop trying to find a recipe that other companies have used for success and start from scratch (with lessons learned from others of course).

One of the most damaging routes a company can take is trying to mimic another. I've been in meetings listening to product managers describe their product roadmap that contains 99% 'me too' features to keep up with their competitors.  When I ask about innovation, I get blank stares.  These folks are stuck in the dogma of their industry and their organization. They are focused on imitation rather than innovation.

That's where being pragmatic comes into play. Sure...there may be features that you <em>must</em> have to compete in your vertical/industry but if you're entire roadmap is focused on imitation, its time to take a step back and rethink your approach, your investment and your business. Rather than mimic everything others are doing (e.g., being dogmatic), take a the pragmatic approach.  Take a look at what your competitors are doing, what your clients want, what you can deliver and what best fits into your organization's long-term goals and then do that.

Another aspect of pragmatic vs dogmatic that I see often is that of project management. How many times have you heard (or said!) ""well...we need to build a gantt chart before the project can start"" or ""that's not how the PMBOK"" says to do it or 'Scrum requires us to do X, Y and Z in that order.""   That's dogmatic.  Not every project requires a gantt chart or a daily 15min standup meeting. Not every organization can (or should) follow the dogma of project management methods.  The most successful project managers out there are those that know when to follow guidelines and when to deviate from said guidelines.

So...be pragmatic, not dogmatic.  Thanks for the quote <a href=""http://chiefmartec.com/"">Scott</a>.",20170928,http://ericbrown.com/be-pragmatic-not-dogmatic.htm,Leadership|Organization,dogma|pragmatic
9770,The Data Way,"<img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-9771"" src=""http://ericbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/BigData-300x209.jpg"" alt=""The Data Way"" width=""300"" height=""209"" />The world has become a world of data. <a href=""https://www.domo.com/learn/data-never-sleeps-5"">According to Domo</a>, the majority of the data (roughly 90% of it) that exists today has been created within the last two years. That’s a lot of data. Actually...that’s a LOT of data. And it's your job to use that data to make better decisions and guide your organization / team to a brighter future.

Whether you’re in marketing, IT, HR, Finance, Sales or any other function within an organization, you have data and you need to figure out how to use that data - but where do you begin?

Many people grab data, throw it into excel and start throwing pivot tables and vlookups at it. If that’s what you do - then more power to you. Personally, I can’t stand vlookups. Truth be told - they don’t like me and subsequently I hate them. Don’t get me wrong - pivot tables and vlookups (and the other useful spreadsheet functionality) can deliver very good insight into your data but only if you know what you’re looking for.

Of course - you have a question or questions you want answered to and that’s what you’re digging into your data. You might want to know what your material costs are going to be for next year. Maybe you want to forecast your sales revenue for the coming quarter. Or, perhaps you want to better understand the differences between pay scales between the different groups of people within your organization.

That’s all well and good but what about all the other questions you don’t know you have? You’ll never find the answers to those questions sticking with pivot tables and vlookups to answer the 'original' question because you didn’t know you were supposed to be asking any additional questions.

When I say this in conversation, I tend to get a lot of questioning looks and responses like ‘that makes no sense’ or ‘I can’t ask questions I don’t know I’m supposed to ask’. Fair enough. I usually respond with the example of the creation of the <a href=""https://www.post-it.com/3M/en_US/post-it/contact-us/about-us/"">Post-it Note by Art Fry at 3M</a>. Nobody at 3M was looking to develop little sticky pieces of paper to be used as notes. They were just trying to create better adhesives when an idea struck Mr. Fry. He needed a bookmark and page marker that wouldn’t fall out. After some trial and error, the Post-it Note was born and now these little notes are part of a multi-billion dollar industry for 3M.

3M and its engineers had no idea they needed/wanted to invent the Post-it note but they were open to exploring new ideas and questions as they arose.

This is the same mindset you need to have with data. Don’t just ‘answer the question’ but keep digging and keep playing.  It can be tough to do that in Excel when stuck in pivot table and vlookup hell, but it can be done. Just keep your curiosity levels high and keep looking for those questions you didn't know you had.

That’s the data way.",20171003,http://ericbrown.com/the-data-way.htm,Big Data|Data Science|Featured,data
